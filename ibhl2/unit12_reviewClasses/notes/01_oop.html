<div id="ib">D.1.1 Outline the general nature of an object.</div>

<p>Real-world objects are everywhere: your dog, your desk, your television, your bicycle, your wallet.
   Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have <strong>state</strong> and <strong>behavior</strong>. 
   Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail).
   Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes).
   The state of an object describes an object's attributes. The behavior of an object describes what it does.</p>

<div id="ib">D.1.2 Distinguish between an object(definition, template or class) and instantiation.</div>

<p>An <strong>object</strong> is defined by a class. A <strong>class</strong> is a description, model, or blueprint from which an object is created. 
  Consider the blueprint created by an architect when designing a house. The blueprint defines the important characteristics
  of the house - its walls, windows, doors, electrical outlets, and so on. Once the blueprint is created, several houses can be built using it.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/classDecomposition3.gif" width="400px"> </div>

<p>The houses built from the blueprint are different. They are in different locations, they have different addresses, contain different
 furniture, and different people live in them. Yet in many ways they are the "same" house. The layout of the rooms, number of windows and doors,
 and so on are the same in each. To create a different house, we would need a different blueprint. A class is a blueprint of an object.
 However, a class is not an object any more than a blueprint is a house.</p>
 
 <p><strong>Instantiation</strong> is process of using a class's constructor to create an object. To instantiate an object in Java you use the keyword <strong>new</strong>.</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>Student student = new Student("John", "Wayne");</pre></div>


<div id="ib">D.1.3 Construct unified modelling language(UML) diagrams to represent object designs.</div>

<p>UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a pictorial language that allows you to describe a software system in visual way.
 A class diagram is a type of UML diagram that describes the attributes and operations of a class. A class diagram also shows 
 the relationship between classes within a software system and it shows the responsibility each class has within the system.</p>

<p>Below is a class diagram for a Lock and a CombinationLock class.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/lockUML.png"></div>

<p>Here is a link to a tutorial on <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-class-diagram/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF">UML</font></a>.</p>

<div id="ib">D.1.4 Interpret UML diagrams</div>

<p>Here is a link to a tutorial on <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-class-diagram/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF">UML</font></a>.</p>

<div id="ib">D.1.5 Describe the process of decomposition into several related objects.</div>

<p><strong>Class decomposition</strong> is the process of breaking a programming problem into multiple classes where each class
 has a specific task to perform in solving the problem.</p>
 
<h3>Class Decomposition Example</h3>

<p>Class decomposition can be illustrated through the problem of running a high school. Running a high school is a major undertaking. 
   The first thing to be done in running a school is for the school board to hire a principal. The principal is the school's manager, 
   he or she is responsible for everything that goes on in the school. The principal, however, cannot run the school alone, the job 
   is just to big. So the principal hires people to help him. He hires assistant principals, counselors, teachers, librarians, coaches,
   secretaries, custodians, lunch workers, nurses, and the list goes on. Each person has a specific job to do in making the school run
   efficiently.</p>

<p>The structure chart for a high school might look like the following.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/classDecomposition1.png"> </div>

<h3>Class Decomposition</h3>

<p>Hypothetically, if we were to write a computer program that solved the problem of running a high school each worker in the school
 would be a class. There would be a principal class, an assistant principal class, a counselor class, a teacher class, and so on. This is
 the process of class decomposition. Just as each worker in the school has a specific job to do, each class within the program has its own
 job to do in helping solve the problem.</p>

<div id="ib">D.1.6 Describe the relationships between objects for a given problem.</div>

<h3>Aggregation</h3>
<p>Here a link to a tutorial on class/object relationships <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-aggregation-vs-composition/" style="color:blue">Link</a></p>
<p>Aggregation is the relationship between two classes where an object of one class has an object of another.</p>
 <p> Aggregation is a <strong>"has a"</strong> relationship. The school has a principal. The team has a coach. The dog has a tail.</p>
 
<div id="csCode"><pre>public class Classroom
{
   private Teacher teacher;   // aggregation: a classroom has a teacher 
   
</pre></div>


<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>Inheritance is a feature that represents the <strong>"is a"</strong> relationship between different classes. Inheritance allows a class
   to have the same behavior as another class and extend or tailor that behavior to provide special action for specific needs.</p>
<p>A high school is a school, a dalmatian is a dog, a corvette is a car.</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>public class CombinationLock extends Lock
{
   // inheritance: a combination lock is a lock 
   
</pre></div>

<div id="ib">D.1.7 Outline the need to reduce dependencies between objects in a given problem.</div>

<h3>What is a Dependency?</h3>
<p>Whenever a class A uses another class, then A depends on B. A cannot carry out it's work without B, and A cannot be reused without
   also reusing B. In such a situation the class A is called the "dependant" and the class B is called the "dependency".
   Two classes that use each other are said to be "coupled".</p>
   
<h3>Why are Dependencies Bad?</h3>
<p>Dependencies are bad because they decrease reuse. Decreased reuse is bad for many reasons. Often reuse has positive impact on
  development speed, code quality, code readability, code maintenance, etc.</p>

<h3>How can Dependencies be Reduced?</h3>
<p>One way object dependencies can be reduced is through the use of <strong>interfaces</strong> and <strong>abstract classes</strong>. 
   Let's look at an example.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a method in a class named printList that takes an ArrayList as a parameter.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public void printList(ArrayList list)
{
    // print the list
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Method printList is dependant upon the ArrayList class. The method is restricted to only working with ArrayList objects.</p>
<p>Now lets modify the method by replacing the ArrayList parameter with a reference to the List interface.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public void printList(List list)
{
    // print the list
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>By referencing the List interface the method is no longer "tightly coupled" to the ArrayList class. This makes the method more useful 
   because it can now print any list that implements the List interface such as the LinkedList class.</p>

<div id="ib">D.1.8 Construct related objects for a given problem.</div>

<div id="csNote">IB documentation states "Examination problems will require students to construct definitions for no more than
three objects and to explain their relationships to each other and to any additional classes defined by the examiners.</div>

<div id="ib">D.1.9 Explain the need for different data types to represent data items.</div>

<p>A data type specifies the size and type of values that can be stored in an identifier or variable. 
  The Java language provides 8 different primitive data types. Different data types allow you to select the
  type appropriate to the needs of the application. For example, if a program only needs variables for operations like counting or summing Java's 
  integer types(int or long) will do, but if the program needs to store data like money that have decimal points it would need to use Java's 
  real number types(float or double).</p>

<div id="ib">D.1.10 Describe how data items can be passed to and from actions as parameters.</div>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
  <p>A <strong>parameter</strong> or argument is a value that is passed to a method so that the method can use
     that value in its processing. A parameter is located
	 inside the parentheses that follow a method name.</p>
	 
	<div align="center"><img src="images/parameter1.png"></div>
	 
	 <p>The value 16 is a parameter or argument for the method sqrt. The method calculates the
	    square root of this value and assigns it to the variable num.</p> 
  <p>A parameter can be a <strong>literal value</strong>.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
Math.sqrt(81)
Math.round(76.9)
str.equals("exit")</pre>
  </div>
  <p>A parameter can be a <strong>variable</strong>.</p>
  <div id="csCode"><pre>
Math.sqrt(num)
Math.round(average)
str.equals(lastName)</pre>
  </div>
    <p>A parameter can be a <strong>mathematical expression</strong>.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
Math.sqrt(20 + 50 + 11)
Math.round((grade1 + grade2 + grade) / 3)</pre>
  </div>
<p>A parameter can be a call to <strong>another method</strong>.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
Math.round(Math.sqrt(35))
Math.max(num3, Math.max(num1, num2))</pre>
  </div>
  <p>A method can be have 0, 1, or <strong>more parameters</strong>. Multiple parameters are separated by commas.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
Math.pow(10, 2)
Math.max(num1, num2)
str.substring(0, str.length()/2)</pre>
  </div>
<h3>Writing a Method with Parameters</h3>
<p>To add parameters to your own method definitions you simply declare one or more variables in the parentheses that follow 
   the method name. These variable declarations need to include a data type and an identifier name. Look at the following example.</p>
     <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
public double average(int gr1, int gr2, int gr3)
{
   return (gr1 + gr2 + gr3) / 3.0;</pre>
}
  </div>
<p>Method average declares three parameters all of type int named gr1, gr2, and gr3. These parameters are used to
   store the value of three grades that are passed to the method. The method uses these parameters
   to calculate the average of the three grades and returns the answer.
<p>Watch the following demonstration to see the order of execution for the method above.</p>

  <div class = "slider" id="slider1">
       <ul class="bjqs">
          <li><img src="images/Parameters1/Slide1.PNG"></li>

    </div>

	<h3>Some More Examples</h3>
	     <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
public void printInfo(String name, int age)
{
   System.out.println("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old");</pre>
}
  </div>
  <br>
 <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
public double area(double length, double width)
{
   return length * width;</pre>
}
  </div>
  
<h1>Parameter Scope</h1>
<p>The scope of a parameter is limited to the method it is declared in. Look at the following
   example. </p>
<div id="csCode">
   <pre>
public int minimum(int num1, int num2)
{
   if(num1 < num2)
     return num1;
   else
     return num2;</pre>
}
  </div>
 <p>The parameters, num1 and num2, have method scope. This means they are <strong>local variables</strong> for the
    method minimum. They do not exist outside this method.</p>	
<br>
<h1>Formal vs Actual Parameters</h1>
<p>There are two types of parameters: formal parameters and actual parameters or arguments. The parameters in the
   header of the method declaration are called <strong>formal parameters</strong>. The values
   passed into a method are called <strong>actual parameters</strong> or <strong>arguments</strong>.</p>
   <div align="center"><img src="images/parameter2.png"></div>

<div id="ib">D.2.1 Define the term encapsulation.</div>

<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is the process of combining variables and methods in a single package called a class.</p> 

<div id="ib">D.2.2 Define the term inheritance.</div>

<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is a feature that represents the <strong>"is a"</strong> relationship between different classes. Inheritance allows a class
   to have the same behavior as another class and extend or tailor that behavior to provide special action for specific needs.</p>

<div id="ib">D.2.3 Define the term polymorphism.</div>

<p><strong>Polymorphism</strong> is a OOP feature that allows values of different data types to be handled using a uniform interface.
This technique provides a consistent interface over a range of implementations.</p>
<p>Polymorphism is implemented in Java in two forms</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><strong>Method Overloading</strong> (compile-time polymorphism) - defining more than one method in a class with the same name.</li>
<li><strong>Method Overriding</strong> (run-time polymorphism) - the ability to redefine methods for derived classes(subclasses).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Method Overloading Example</h3>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
// calculates and returns area of a rectangle
public double <div id="csHighlight"><pre>area</pre></div>(int length, int width)
{  
    return length * width;
}

// calculates and returns area of a circle
public double <div id="csHighlight"><pre>area</pre></div>(int radius)
{
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}

</pre>
</div>
<p>Two methods are defined both with the name area. The first method calculates the area of a rectangle and the second calculates the 
   area of a circle.</p>
   
<h3>Method Overriding Example</h3>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Hamburger
{
    public String <div id="csHighlight"><pre>getFood</pre></div>()
    {
        return "hamburger";
    }
}

public class Meal extends Hamburger
{
    // override
    public String <div id="csHighlight"><pre>getFood</pre></div>()
    {
        return super.getFood() + " french fries" + " drink"; 
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Method getFood is overridden (redefined) in the Meal subclass so that it also includes french fries and a drink.</p>
<div id="ib">D.2.4 Explain the advantages of encapsulation.</div>

   <p>One aspect of encapsulation is the principle of <strong>information hiding</strong>. With information hiding objects hide their data
   (instance variables) from other classes by allowing access to the data only through the public methods defined within the class. 
   Encapsulation therefore guarantees the integrity of the data contained in the object by controlling how the data is accessed and modified.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Encapsulation</h3>
  <div id="csList">
  <ul>
    <li>It simplifies the interaction between objects.</li>
	<li>Allows a class to hide the internal details of how an object does something. </li>
	<li>A class can change its internal implementation without hurting the overall functionality of the system.</li>	
	<li>Prevents code (data) from accidental corruption due to programming errors. </li>
</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

<div id="ib">D.2.5 Explain the advantages of inheritance.</div>

<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Code Reuse - don't have to rewrite common code.</li>
<li>Extensibility - code is well structured so easier to expand or update.</li>
<li>Easier Maintenance - code is well structured so it is easier to maintain.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="ib">D.2.6 Explain the advantages of polymorphism.</div>

<p>Polymorphism provides programmers the ability to treat objects of derived classes as if they were objects of the base class.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Polymorphism</h3>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li>Common Interface - a programmer only has to learn one method name for a multitude of implementations.</li>
<li>Extensibility - a program that uses polymorphism is capable of handling any new requirements or 
enhancements that arise in the future due to its common interface.</li>
<li>Code Reuse - if an application does not use a common interface it will need to
change and duplicate most of its code to support new implementations.</li>
</ul></div>

<div id="ib">D.2.7 Describe the advantages of libraries of objects.</div>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li>Increased productivity - programmers don't have to "reinvent the wheel."</li>
<li>Efficient code - code in libraries is typically stable and optimized.</li>
<li>Code reuse</li>
</div></ul>

<div id="ib">D.2.8 Describe the disadvantages of OOP.</div>

<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Size - OOP programs are generally larger than normal programs.</li>
<li>Speed - OOP programs are generally slower than normal programs.</li>
<li>Effort - OOP programs require a lot more time and effort to create.</li>
<li>Learning - there is a larger learning curve when it comes to knowing how to develop OOP applications.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>*In recent years the size and speed issues have been greatly improved, but the issue of effort still remains. </p>

<div id="ib">D.2.9 Discuss the use of programming teams.</div>

<p>A <strong>programming team</strong> is a team of people who develop or maintain computer software.
The team programming approach has been utilized for many years but this approach has become even more important with the increased popularity of
object-oriented programming. 
Many of the strategies used in a team programming approach involve multiple programmers working collaboratively on the same piece
 of source code as opposed to being individually responsible for individual tasks. 
  Benefits of this approach include the ability for deficiencies in knowledge and ability in specific areas to be compensated
   for by the other programmer; in addition, the shared responsibility is thought to increase incentives for meeting project
   deadlines and quality targets. Therefore a team approach is more productive.</p>

<div id="ib">D.2.10 Explain the advantages of modularity in program development.</div>

<div id="csList"><ul>
<li>Increased production - several programmers can work on individual programs at the same time, thus, making development of programs faster.</li> 
<li>Better usability - code is easier to read and understand.</li>
<li>Easier maintenance - code is easier to debug, update, and modify.</li>
<li>Code reuse</li>
</ul></div>

<div id="ib">D.3.9 Discuss the features of modern programming languages that enable internationalization.</div>

<p>By using the <strong>Unicode</strong> character set instead of ASCII applications can store data for any language in the world.
   Also a program's user interface can be customized to meet the needs of the user.</p>

<div id="ib">D.3.10 Discuss the ethical and moral obligations of programmers.</div>

<p>"Do programmers have responsibility for how their code is used? What if a programmer writes code to pry into confidential information or
  copy-protected material? Does he bear responsibility along with the person who used the program? What about a programmer who knowingly or
  unknowingly writes code to "fix the books?" Should he be liable? What about software sabotage? Software warfare? Do programmers have a moral
  responsibility if they write software that the CIA uses to disrupt communications or in other ways destabilize a foreign country? Given
  the damage such software could potentially do, isn't that software team potentially more morally bankrupt than the Manhattan Project team?
  What about the team writing software for sophisticated weaponry? Do they have blood on their hands? How about writing a Web site so that a
  hate group can spread its message? What about writing the software that powers porn sites? Do developers have any control over how their software
  is used?"</p>
