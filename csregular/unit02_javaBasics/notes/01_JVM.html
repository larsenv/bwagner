  <h1>Java Programming Language</h1>
  <p>A <strong>programming language</strong> is simply a language used to write instructions for a computer.
     Currently Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Java has such
	 a large following because it can be used on a multitude of electronic devices including
	 computers, tablets, cell phones, navigation systems, printers, Blu-ray players, web cams,
	 set-top boxes, medical devices, and more.</p>
  <p>You can run Java programs on a wide variety of computers using a range of 
    operating systems. Your Java programs will run just as well on a PC running 
    Windows as it will on Linux or Mac OS. This is possible because a Java program 
    does not execute directly on your computer. It runs on a standardized hypothetical 
    computer that is called the <strong>Java virtual machine</strong> or JVM, 
    which is emulated inside your computer by a program. A Java <strong>compiler</strong> 
    converts the Java source code(.java) that you write into a binary program 
    consisting of byte codes(.class). Byte codes are machine instructions of the 
    Java virtual machine. When you execute a Java program, a program called the 
    <strong>Java interpreter</strong> inspects and deciphers the bytes codes for 
    it, checks it out to ensure that it has not been tampered with and is safe 
    to execute, and then executes the actions that the byte codes specify within 
    the Java virtual machine. Because your Java program consists of byte codes 
    rather than native machine language instructions, it is completely insulated 
    from the particular hardware on which it is run.</p>
