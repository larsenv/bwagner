  <h1>Representing Positive Integers</h1>
  <p>As we discussed in the previous section, the electrical circuitry of modern computers is specifically designed to
     store and manipulate binary data. To better understand how data is represented in the computer
	 we must first define two words that are used to describe binary data, namely, <strong>bit</strong> and <strong>byte</strong>.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>bit</strong> - binary digit, a 0 or 1</li>
	  <li><strong>byte</strong> - a series of 8 bits, 10010101</li>
   </ul> 
   <p>A byte is a unit of measurement for binary data. All binary data in the computer are stored as one or more bytes.
      The largest positive integer that can be represented with one byte is 11111111 (255<sub>10</sub>). Obviously, computers
	  need to be able to store numbers larger than 255, so computers store integer values in multiple bytes. The table
	  below lists various positive integers and the 4 byte binary number that the computer would use to store the number.

  <h1>Representing Negative Integers</h1>
  <p>As you can see, it is not difficult for computers to represent positive integers 
    using binary numbers but what about negative numbers? How do you represent 
    negative values using binary numbers? Aren't negative numbers just numbers 
    with a minus sign in front? Perhaps. That is certainly one valid way to think 
    about them. However, that is not the way computers do it. Not because they 
    can't, it just turns out there is an easier, less complex way. Most computer 
    hardware uses a technique called <strong>two's complement</strong>.</p>
	 
	 <p>View the presentation below that demonstrates two's complement representation of
	   negative binary numbers.</p>

	<h1>Representing Real Numbers</h1>
	<p>In computing, we call all noninteger values <strong>real numbers</strong>.
	   A real number can be defined as a value with a potential fractional part.
	   That is, real numbers have a whole part and a fractional part, either of
	   which may be zero. For example, some real numbers in base 10 are
	   104.32, 0.99999999, 357.0, and 3.14159.</p>
	<p>The table below illustrates base 10 positional notation including a fractional
	   part. The position values come from raising the base value to increasing powers
	   (moving from decimal point to the left). The positions to the right of the
	   decimal point work the same way, except that the powers are negative.</p>
	   
  <div align="center"><img src="images/real1.png" width="500" height="95"><br>
    *10<SUP>-3</SUP> = 1/1000
    
  <p>In binary, the same rules apply but the base value is 2. Since we are not 
    working in base 10, the decimal point is referred to as a <strong>radix point</strong>, 
    a term that can be used with any base.</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/real2.png" width="500" height="95"></div>
  <p>How do we represent a real value in the computer? We store the value as an 
    integer and include information showing where the radix point is. That is, 
    any real value can be described by three properties: the sign (positive or 
    negative); the mantissa, which is made up of the digits in the value with 
    radix point assumed to be to the right; and the exponent, which determines 
    how the radix point is shifted relative to the mantissa. A real value in base 
    10 can, therefore, be defined by the following formula:</p>
  <div><img src="images/real3.png"></div>
  <p>This representation is called <strong>floating point</strong> because the 
    number of digits is fixed but the radix point floats. When a value is in floating-point 
    form, a positive exponent shifts the decimal point to the right, and a negative 
    exponent shifts the decimal point to the left. The table below shows some 
    values in decimal notation and their corresponding floating-point notation. 
    For the sake of the discussion, we assume that only five digits can be represented 
    in the mantissa.</p>
  <table id="csTable">
   <tr>
      <th>Real Value</th>
      <th>Floating-Point Value (five digits)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>12001.00</td>
      <td>12001*10<sup>0</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-120.01</td>
      <td>-12001*10<sup>-2</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.12000</td>
      <td>12000*10<sup>-5</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-123.10</td>
      <td>-12310*10<sup>-2</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>155555000.00</td>
      <td>15555*10<sup>4</sup></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Notice that in the last example, we lose information. Because we are storing only
     five digits to represent the significant digits (the mantissa), the whole part of the
	 value is not accurately represented in floating-point notation.</p>
  <p>Likewise, a binary floating-point value is defined by the following formula:</p>
  <div><img src="images/real4.png"></div>
  <p>Note that only the base value has changed. Of course, in this scheme the 
    mantissa would contain only binary digits. To store a floating-point number 
    on a computer, we can store the three values that define it (sign, mantissa, 
    and exponent). For example, according to one common standard, if we devote 
    64 bits (8 bytes) to the storage of a floating-point value we use 1 bit for 
    the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the mantissa.</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/real5.png"></div>
  <p>Both the mantissa and the exponent are stored as binary numbers. There are several
     different formats used to store these two numbers in memory. Some of the formats
	 use two's complement form to store one or both of the numbers; other formats do not.
	 This topic, however, is beyond the level of our discussion.</p>
   <p>We saw in an earlier lesson how to convert a base 10 number to binary, but what
      about the fractional part of a decimal number? How do you convert the fractional
	  part of a decimal number into binary? View the presentation below to see how.</p>
