<p> A set of classes is used to handle the different ticket types for a theater. The class hierarchy is shown in the following diagram.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/ticket.gif"></div>
<p>All tickets have a serial number and a price. The class <strong>Ticket</strong> is specified as an abstract class as shown in the following declaration.</p>
<div id="apCode">
<pre>
public abstract class Ticket 
{ 
   private int serialNumber;   // unique ticket id number 

   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public Ticket()</pre></div> 
   {   serialNumber = getNextSerialNumber();   } 

   // returns the price for this ticket 
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public abstract double getPrice();</pre></div> 

   // returns a string with information about the ticket 
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public String toString()</pre></div> 
   { 
       return "Number: " + serialNumber + "\nPrice: " + getPrice();
   }
 
   // returns a new unique serial number 
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>private static int getNextSerialNumber()</pre></div> 
   {  /* implementation not shown */   }
} 
</pre>
</div>
<p>Each ticket has a unique serial number that is assigned when the ticket is constructed. For all ticket classes,
   the toString method returns a string containing the information for that ticket. Three additional classes are 
   used to represent the different types of tickets and are described in the table below. </p>
   
<table width="70%" id="csTable">
        <tr> 
          <th>Class</th>
          <th width="50%">Description</th>
          <th>Sample toString Output</th>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Walkup</td>
          <td width="50%">These tickets are purchased on the day of the event 
            and cost 50 dollars.</td>
          <td>Number: 712<br>
            Price: 50 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Advance</td>
          <td width="50%">Tickets purchased ten or more days in advance cost 30 
            dollars. Tickets purchased fewer than ten days in advance cost 40 
            dollars.<br></td>
          <td>Number: 357<br>
            Price: 40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>StudentAdvance</td>
          <td width="50%">These tickets are a type of Advance ticket that costs 
            half of what that Advance ticket would normally cost.<br></td>
          <td>Number: 134<br>
            Price: 15<br>
            (student ID required) </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
<p>Using the class hierarchy and specifications given above, you will write complete class declarations for the <strong>Advance</strong>
       and <strong>StudentAdvance</strong> classes.</p>
<div id="csList2">
<ol>
<li><p>Write the complete class declaration for the class <strong>Advance</strong>. Include all necessary instance variables and
    implementations of its constructor and method(s). The constructor should take a parameter that indicates the
    number of days in advance that this ticket is being purchased. Tickets purchased ten or more days in advance
    cost $30; tickets purchased nine or fewer days in advance cost $40.</p></li>
<li><p>
    Write the complete class declaration for the class <strong>StudentAdvance</strong>. Include all necessary instance
    variables and implementations of its constructor and method(s). The constructor should take a parameter that indicates the number of days in advance that this ticket is being purchased. The toString method should include a notation that a student ID is required for this ticket. A StudentAdvance ticket costs half of
    what that Advance ticket would normally cost. If the pricing scheme for Advance tickets changes,
    the StudentAdvance price should continue to be computed correctly with no code modifications to
    the StudentAdvance class.</p></li>
