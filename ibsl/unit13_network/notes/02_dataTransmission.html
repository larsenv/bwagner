<h1>Data Transmission</h1>
<div id="ib">3.1.6 Define the terms: protocol, data packet.</div>
<p>A <strong>network protocol</strong> defines rules and conventions for communication between network devices. 
   A protocol is, in one sense, nothing more than an agreement that a particular type of data will be formatted in a particular
   manner. HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, IMAP, TCP are all examples of network protocols.</p>
<p>A <strong>data packet</strong> contains data traveling over a network. It is a basic unit of binary data for communication over a digital
   network.</p>

<div id="ib">3.1.7 Explain why protocols are necessary.</div>

<p>Many protocols have been defined to assist in network communication. Some of these protocols were developed to help resolve communication
   problems like data integrity, flow control, deadlock, congestion, and error checking.</p>

<h3>Data Integrity</h3>
<p><strong>Data integrity</strong>, in the context of networking, refers to the overall completeness, accuracy and consistency of data. Data integrity must 
   be imposed when sending data through a network.  In other words, how does a computer know that when it receives data over a network that
   it is complete, accurate, and consistent. This can be achieved by using error checking and correction protocols.</p>
  
<h3>Flow Control</h3>
<p><strong>Flow control</strong> is utilized in data communications to manage the flow of data among two different network devices, especially in cases where
   the sending device can send data much faster than the receiver can digest.</p>
<p>Networks of any size have many different devices connected and each device has unique data transmission abilities. For instance, 
   a router is built to manage the routing of data whereas a desktop, at the receiving end of that data, has far less sending/receiving 
   abilities. These differences in sending/receiving abilities may lead to conflict if the sender starts transmitting data faster than the receiving
   devices's ability. To counteract this problem, a flow control protocol is used. </p>
  <p>Xon-Xoff is an example of a flow control protocol that syncs the sender with 
    the receiver. It transmits a transmit off signal when the receiver no longer 
    has space in its buffer(memory) and a transmit on signal when the receiver 
    can resume taking data.</p>
	
<h3>DeadLock</h3>
<p>Computer networks are based on passing messages from computer to computer. The computers must have a protocol established that determines the 
   order of communication. Without a proper protocol a situation called a deadlock can occur. A <strong>deadlock</strong> is a situation
   in which two or more communicating computers are each waiting for the other to send a message, and thus neither ever does. In a networking
   environment, deadlocks can occur due to lost or corrupt signals during communication. A protocol must be in place to handle these types
   of situations or the communicating will break down.</p>
   
<h3>Congestion</h3>
<p>Network devices have a memory location called a buffer that is used to store data that has been sent to them from another source. If this buffer becomes
   full and cannot handle any more data a problem known as congestion occurs.<strong>Congestion</strong> occurs when the source sends more data
   than the destination can handle. When this congestion occurs performance will degrade.</p>
<p>When congestion occurs, the destination device has only two options with
   the arriving data packets, to drop them or keep them. A protocol determines whether the destination device keeps the old packets and drops the new 
   packets or it keeps the new packets and drops the old packets. In both the cases packets are dropped.</p>
<p>As an example, the TCP protocol is responsible for setting the policies for congestion that occurs with packets sent over the Internet.</p>
	
<h3>Error Checking</h3>
<p>Data that is transmitted over communication lines is subject to interference (noise) which can alter the nature of the data represented.
    Error checking protocols exist to check such errors and, if an error is detected the network, will try to recover the data, often by requesting
	a resend of the data packets.</p>

<div id="csList">
<h3>Reduncancy</h3>

<p>The central concept in detecting or correcting errors is 
redundancy. A redundancy check is extra data added to a message for the purposes of error detection. Several schemes exist to 
 achieve error detection, and are generally quite simple. All error detection codes transmit more bits than were in the original data.</p> 
<p>The receiver applies the same algorithm to the received data bits and compares its output to the received check bits; if the values
 do not match, an error has occurred at some point during the transmission.</p>

<p>Two common schemes used in redundant error checking are parity checking and check sum.</p>

<h3>Parity Checking</h3>
<p>Parity Checking is one of the easiest error checking methods to implement. 
In this technique, a redundant bit called a parity bit is added 
to every data unit so that the total number of 1's in the unit 
(including the parity bit) becomes even (or odd). </p>
<p>For example, suppose a sender wants to transmit the binary data 11000001.
The sender starts by adding up all of the 1 bits. Since 11000001 contains three 1's the sum is an odd number.
In an even parity scheme, a parity bit of 1 would be added to the data to make it add up to four, which is an even number.
<div id="csOutput" style="width:100px">
    11000001<font color="#FF0000">1</font>
</div>
In an odd parity scheme, a parity bit of 0 would be added to the data to retain the odd numbered sum.</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:100px">
    11000001<font color="#FF0000">0</font>
</div>

<p>A parity check can detect all single-bit errors. However, if any two bits change 
in transmission, the changes cancel each other and the data 
unit will pass a parity check even though the data is 
damaged.</p>

<h3>Checksum</h3>
<p>The another simple method of verifying the integrity of digitally transmitted data is the checksum method.  
A checksum can be computed in many different ways, using different algorithms. For example, one algorithm computes a checksum value 
by adding together all the numbers in the input data. If the sum of all the numbers exceeds the highest value that a checksum 
can hold, the checksum equals the modulus of the total--that is, the remainder that's left over when the total is divided by the
checksum's maximum possible value plus 1. In mathematical terms, a checksum is computed with the equation</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:300px" >
    Checksum = Total % (MaxVal + 1)
</div>
<p>where Total equals the sum of the input data and MaxVal is the maximum checksum value you will allow.</p>
<p>Suppose the data whose contents you wish to verify is the following stream of 10 byte values:</p>
<div id="csOutput" style="width:300px">
   36 211 163 4 109 192 58 247 47 92 
</div>
<p>If the checksum is a 1-byte value, then it can't hold a number greater than 255. The sum of the values
   in the above data is 1,159, so the 8-bit checksum is the remainder left when 1,159 is divided by 256, or 135. If
   the sender of the data calculated a checksum of, say, 135, and the receiver got a checksum of 246, then the data
   was damaged during transmission.</p>

<p>The problem with checksums is that although conflicting checksums are proof positive that transmitted data has been damaged,
matching checksums doesn't necessarily prove that the data was not altered. You can reorder the numbers in the data set
any way you want and the checksum won't change. Worse, you can change individual numbers and tweak others
so that the checksum comes out the same.  Therefore, more advanced checksum algorithms are typically used to verify data. 
These include cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithms and cryptographic hash functions.</p>

<div id="ib">3.1.8 Explain why the speed of data transmission across a network can vary.</div>

<p>Data transmitted over a network is packaged and transported in small pieces of data.
The flow of these small pieces of data directly affects a user's experience.
When data packets arrive in a smooth and timely manner the user sees a continuous flow of data;
if data packets arrive with large and variable delays between packets the user's experience is degraded.</p>

<p>The <strong>latency</strong> of a network connection represents the amount of time required for data to travel between
   the sender and receiver. While all computer networks possess some inherent amount of latency, the amount varies and can 
   suddenly increase for various reasons. People perceive these unexpected time delays as lag.</p>
<p>Here are some causes of lag:</p>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p>Length of the route that the packets have to take between sender and receiver.</p></li>
<li><p>Type of media transporting the data.(e.g. fiber optics, satellite, wireless, metal wiring)</p></li>
<li><p>Network congestion - causes data to be retransmitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Traffic load - how many people are using network.</p></li>
<li><p>Time of day - people use network more during peek times.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather - satellite and wireless signal interference.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<div id="ib">3.1.9 Explain why compression of data is often necessary when transmitting across a network.</div>

<p>Data compression is the process of encoding data to take up less storage space and less bandwidth for transmission. Digital data are compressed by 
finding repeatable patterns of binary 0s and 1s. The more patterns can be found, the more the data can be compressed. Text can
typically be compressed to approximately 40% of its original size, and graphics files from 20% to 90%. Some files compress very 
little. It depends entirely on the type of compression algorithm used. As an example, the zip file format utilizes a common compression algorithm.</p>

<p>Data compression has enabled information to be disseminated more rapidly.</p>

  <div id="ib">3.1.11 Explain how data is transmitted by packet switching.</div>

  <p><strong>Packet switching</strong> is a network technology that breaks up a message into smaller 
    chunks (packets) for transmission. Unlike circuit switching in traditional 
    telephone networks, which requires the establishment of a dedicated point-to-point 
    connection, each packet in a packet-switched network contains a destination 
    address. Thus, all packets in a single message do not have to travel the same 
    path. As traffic conditions change, they can be dynamically routed via different 
    paths in the network, and they can even arrive out of order. The destination 
    computer reassembles the packets into their proper sequence.</p>
  <p>Below are the steps used to send packets over a network using packet switching:</p>
  <div id="csList">
  <ol>
  <li>The sending computer chops data into small packets, with an address on each
  one telling the network devices where to send them.</li>
  <li>Each packet is assembled with a small piece of an e-mail,
  music file or whatever type of file is being transmitted inside the packet.</li>
  <li>The sending computer sends the packet to a nearby router and forgets about
  it. The nearby router sends the packet to another router that is closer to the
  recipient computer. That router sends the packet along to another, even closer
  router, and so on.</li>
  <li>When the receiving computer finally gets the packets (which may have all taken
  completely different paths to get there), it uses instructions contained within
  the packets to reassemble the data into its original state.</li>
  </ol></div>

<p>Packet switching is very efficient. It lets the network route the packets
  along the least congested and cheapest lines. It also frees up the two computers
  communicating with each other so that they can accept information from other
  computers, as well.</p>
<p>Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is an example of a 
    packet switching protocol. Some mobile phone technologies also use packet 
    switching technologies.</p>
