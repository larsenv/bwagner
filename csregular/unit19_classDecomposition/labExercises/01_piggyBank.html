<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>In this assignment we are going to write a program that simulates the operation of a piggy bank.
   A piggy bank allows you to enter coins through a slot in the top. When the piggy bank is full
   you can retrieve the money by smashing it on the ground or hitting it with a hammer.</p>
<p>Using class decomposition we are going to decompose this problem into two classes. The first class will be named <strong>PiggyBank</strong>. Its
   job will be to store the money that is inserted into the bank. The second class will be named
   <strong>PiggyBankManager</strong>. Its job will be to manage the program by creating a PiggyBank object
   that it can send messages to asking it to store the coins as they are inserted into the bank. This class will contain the main
   method for the program.</p>
   <h2>PiggyBank class</h2>
   <p>Using method decomposition the PiggyBank class can be decomposed into the following methods.</p>
   <div align="center"><img src="images/piggybank2.png"></div>
   <p>Create a file named <strong>PiggyBank.java</strong> and add the following code.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
public class PiggyBank
{
    // instance variables
    
    
    // methods
        
} </pre>
</div>
<p>Recall that a class is defined by two things: what it stores (variables) and what it does (methods).
   What a piggy bank stores is money in the form of coins. To simulate the storing of coins add the
   following variables to the PiggyBank class under the instance variables section.</p>
      <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
private int quarters;   // number of quarters
private int dimes;      // number of dimes
private int nickels;    // number of nickels
private int pennies;    // number of pennies
</pre>
</div>
  <p>What a piggy bank does is allow a person to insert coins in the bank. To 
    provide this capability add the following method declarations to the PiggyBank 
    class under the methods section.</p>
      <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
// increases the number of quarters in the bank by one
public void insertQuarter()
{

}

// increases the number of dimes in the bank by one
public void insertDime()
{

}

// increases the number of nickels in the bank by one
public void insertNickel()
{

}

// increases the number of pennies in the bank by one
public void insertPenny()
{

}</pre>
</div>
<p>To allow a user to retrieve the money that has been inserted into the bank add the
   following method to the class.</p>
<div id="csCode">
   <pre>
/* This method returns the total number of cents in the piggy bank
 * @ return total cents in the bank
 */
public int smashBank()
{

}</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Implement PiggyBank Methods</strong></p>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Implement the methods <strong>insertQuarter</strong>, <strong>insertDime</strong>, <strong>insertNickel</strong>, and <strong>insertPenny</strong>
    so that each method's corresponding instance variable is incremented by one.</p>
	<p>For example, the job of the <strong>insertQuarter</strong> method is to allow a user to add a quarter to the bank. To provide this 
	capability the insertQuarter method should include code that increases the <strong>quarters</strong> variable by one.</p> </li><br>
<li><p>Implement the method <strong>smashBank</strong>.  The purpose of this method is to allow a user to see how much money has been added to
    the piggy bank. To do this the smashbank method needs to add the total number of cents that the bank has collected. To calculate the total 
	cents use the following formula:</p>
	
	<div id="csCode" style="width:520px">
	<pre>totalCents = quarters * 25 + dimes * 10 + nickels * 5 + pennies</pre></div>
	<p>The smashbank method is a non-void method so it needs to return the total cents calculated.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>PiggyBankManager class</h2>
<p>The job of the PiggyBankManager class is to manage the program by interacting with a PiggyBank 
   object. The code for this class is fairly simple so we will place it all inside the main method.</p>
<p>Create a file named <strong>PiggyBankManager.java</strong> and add the following code.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
public class PiggyBankManager
{
     public static void main(String[] args)
     {
	 
     }      
} </pre>
</div>
<p>The first step in allowing the PiggyBankManager class to communicate with the PiggyBank class is
   for the PiggyBankManager class to instantiate a PiggyBank object. To do this add the following code to the
   main method.</p>
      <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
PiggyBank bank = new PiggyBank();      // instantiate object</pre>
</div>
<div id="csNote">Remember <strong>Jeroo</strong>: &nbsp;Jeroo bob = new Jeroo();
</div>
<p>The PiggyBankManager class can now communicate with the PiggyBank object by calling its public
   methods. Add the following code to the main method which will insert 2 quarters, 2 dimes, 
   1 nickel, and 2 pennies into the piggy bank.</p>
        <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
bank.insertDime();          // add a dime
bank.insertQuarter();       // add a quarter
bank.insertPenny();         // add a penny
bank.insertNickel();        // add a nickel
bank.insertQuarter();       // add a quarter
bank.insertDime();          // add a dime
bank.insertPenny();         // and a penny</pre>
</div>
<div id="csNote">Remember <strong>Jeroo</strong>: &nbsp;bob.hop();</div>
<p>To see how much money has been add to the bank call the method smashBank by adding the following
   code.</p>
<div id="csCode">
   <pre>
System.out.println("Your bank has been smashed!");
System.out.println("You saved " + bank.smashBank() + " cents.");
System.out.println();</pre>
</div>
<p>Compile and run the program.</p>
