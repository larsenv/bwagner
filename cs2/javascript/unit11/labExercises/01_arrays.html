<li><p>Sam enjoys his sleep so much that he always waits as longer as possible before 
       getting out of bed to go to school. He is also very indecisive in the morning and can
       never seem to make up his mind what he wants to eat for breakfast. This indecision costs 
       him precious time. Time he does not have. However he thinks he has found a solution. He
       has asked you to write a program that he can access on his phone that will select
       his breakfast for him simply by pressing a button.</p></li>
    
<li><p>Here is a list of Sam's twelve favorite breakfast foods.</p>
    <ul id="csList">
        <li><p>cereal</p></li>
        <li><p>Pop Tarts</p></li>
        <li><p>Toaster Strudel</p></li>
        <li><p>egg and bacon muffin</p></li>
        <li><p>sausage biscuit</p></li>
        <li><p>oatmeal</p></li>
        <li><p>cinnamon rolls</p></li>
        <li><p>cinnamon toast</p></li>
        <li><p>frozen pancakes</p></li>
        <li><p>frozen waffles</p></li>
        <li><p>bagel</p></li>
        <li><p>fruit</p></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><p>Write a Javascript program that uses an array to store his twelve breakfast choices. Provide a button
       named "Select Breakfast" that when clicked will randomly select from the array one of
       his choices and display it on the screen like the sample output shown below.</p></li>
<li><p>Use internal styling to enhance the user interface.</p></li>
<li><p>You will need to use the Math class's <strong>floor</strong> method to convert the
       random number to an integer.</p></li>
