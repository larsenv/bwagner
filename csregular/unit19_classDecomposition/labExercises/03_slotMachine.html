<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>In this assignment we are going to write a class that simulates the operation of a slot
     machine. There are many different kinds of slot machines today. One of the more traditional
     slot machines has three rollers that contain pictures of fruit. A user pulls a lever which
	 causes the rollers to spin. After spinning for a few seconds each roller stops on one of
	 the fruit pictures. If all three rollers display the same fruit, then the user wins. When
	 there is a winner the slot machine pays off at different amounts. There is a 60% chance that
	 it will pay off between 1 and 10 dollars, a 30% chance that it will pay off between 11 and
	 100 dollars, and a 10% chance the winner will get the jackpot of 10,000 dollars.</p>
  <p>Using class decomposition we are going to decompose this problem into two classes. The first class will be named <strong>SlotMachine</strong>. It's
   job will be to store the jackpot and provide methods to allow a user to play the game. The second class will be named
   <strong>PlaySlots</strong>. It's job will be to manage the program by creating a SlotMachine object
   that it can send messages to allow the user to play the game. This class will contain the main
   method for the program.</p>
      <h2>SlotMachine class</h2>
   <p>Using method decomposition the SlotMachine class can be decomposed into the following methods.</p>
   <div align="center"><img src="images/slotmachine2.png"></div>
   <p>Create a file named <strong>SlotMachine.java</strong> and add the following code.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
public class SlotMachine
{
    // constants 
	
	
    // instance variables
 
    
    // methods
        
} </pre>
</div>
<p>Recall that a class is defined by two things: what it stores (variables) and what it does (methods).
   What a slot machine stores is the current value of each roller. To simulate the
   storing of the roller values add the following variables to the SlotMachine class under
   the instance variables section.</p>
      <div id="csCode">
   <pre>private int roller1;  
private int roller2;   
private int roller3;   
private int cash = 50;     // $50 is the amount of money you start with
</pre>
</div>
<p>In this class we are adding a new section called constants. A <strong>constant</strong> is a special kind of variable
declared with the keyword <strong>final</strong>. The difference between a 
constant and a variable is that a constant cannot be changed once it has been assigned a value.
Since constants cannot be changed it is not necessary to declare them with the private visibility
modifier instead it is customary to declare them public.</p>
<p>Add the following code to the constants section of the class.</p>
<div id="csCode">
   <pre>public final int CHERRIES = 0;
public final int APPLE = 1;
public final int ORANGE = 2;
public final int LEMON = 3;
public final int BANANA = 4;</pre></div> 
<p>A common programming practice is to use constants to assign names to numbers. In the SlotMachine
  class 5 constants are defined: CHERRIES, APPLE, ORANGE, LEMON, and BANANA. A value of zero represents 
  cherries, 1 represents apples, 2 represents orange, and so on. Therefore, anytime the class needs to refer cherries
  the constant CHERRIES can be used instead of the number zero. This makes the program easier to read.</p>

<div id="csNote"><strong>Note:</strong> It is a common practice to declare constants in all uppercase letters.</div> 

<p>The SlotMachine class provides methods that allow a user to play the game. Add the following
   methods to the class.</p>
      <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
/* This method randomly selects a fruit for each of the three rollers.
 */
public void pullLever()
{

}

/* This method displays the type of fruit contained in each roller.
 */
public void displayRollers()
{

}
/* This method determines the amount of pay off when there is a winner
 * @ return the amount of payoff
 */
private int getPayOff()
{

}

/* This method displays the results of pulling the lever.
 */
public void displayResults()
{

}

// returns the amount of cash you current have
public int getCash()
{
    return cash;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Implement SlotMachine Methods</strong></p>
<ol id="csList">
<li>Implement the method <strong>pullLever</strong>. This method randomly selects
    a fruit for each of the three rollers by generating 3 random numbers in the range
    of 0 to 4 and assigning one of the random numbers to each of the three rollers.</li><br>
<li>Implement the method <strong>displayRollers</strong>. This method displays the type of
    fruit contained in each roller. For example, if roller1 has a value of 0 the word
	Cherries would be displayed, if it has a value of 1 the word Apple would be displayed,
    and so forth.<br><br>
	Here is a sample output.
	<div id="csOutput"><pre>Orange Banana Cherries</pre></div></li><br>
<li>Implement the method <strong>getPayOff</strong>. This method determines the amount of pay off
    when there is a winner. There is a 60% chance it will pay out bewteen 1 and 10 dollars, a
	30% chance it will pay out between 11 and 100 dollars, and a 10% chance the winner will win
	the jackpot of 10,000 dollars.<br><br>
	Here is the pseudocode for the method.<br>
	<div id="csOutput" style="width:600px"><pre>
generate random number between 0 and 9 inclusive

if random number is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 6 
    return a random number between 1 and 10 inclusive
else if random number is greater than or equal to 6 and less than 9 
    return a random number between 11 and 100 inclusive
else
    return 10000</pre></div></li><br>
	
<li>Implement the method <strong>displayResults</strong>.This method displays
    the results of pulling the lever. Before the player can pull the lever they must
	insert a dollar into the slotMachine. This can be simulated by decreasing the 
	<strong>cash</strong> variable by 1. If the rollers do not all match then there
	is not a winner and the method should display the following message.<br><br>
	<div id="csOutput"><pre>
No winner. Please try again.
cash = $ (new balance)
	</pre></div>
	If there is a winner the method should call the helper method <strong>getPayOff</strong> to 
	determine the amount of the pay off. The player's cash balance need to increase by the
	amount of the pay off. A message showing the amount of the payOff and the new cash balance should
	be displayed when there is a winner. The message should be similar to one shown below.<br><br>
		<div id="csOutput"><pre>
************************
         Winner
************************

You won $(amount of pay off)
cash = $ (new balance)

	</pre></div>
	</li><br>
</ol>

<h2>PlaySlots class</h2>
<p>The job of the PlaySlots class is to manage the program by interacting with a SlotMachine
   object so that a user can play the game.</p>
<p><strong>Implement the main method</strong></p>
<ol id="csList">
<li>Instaniate a SlotMachine object. </li>
<li>Instaniate a Scanner object. </li>
<li>Display the following message:<br><br>
		<div id="csOutput"><pre>
1. Pull Lever 2. Quit -->
	</pre></div>
As long as the player responds with a one they should be allowed play slots game by
<ul id="csList">
<li>pulling the lever</li>
<li>display the rollers</li>
<li>display the results of the lever pull</li>
</ul>
However, iff the player's cash balance reaches 0 stop letting them play the game and
display a message similar to the following: "Go home you are broke!"
	</li>
</li>
</ol>
