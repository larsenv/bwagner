<h1>Lesson</h1>
<p>An <strong>editor</strong> is a computer program that enables a user to add or edit text. 
   Editor's can be as simple as NotePad or as complex as Microsoft Word. In the world of web design,
   there are editors specifically designed to make the creation of web documents easier and faster.
   Here is a list of some of the most popular of today's editors.</p>
<ul id="csList">
   <li><p>NotePad++</p></li>
   <li><p>Sublime Text</p></li>
   <li><p>Atom</p></li>
   <li><p>Vim</p></li>
   <li><p>Visual Studio Code</p></li>
   <li><p>Brackets</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the editors listed are free to use except for Sublime Text. Currently my favorite editor is <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> developed by Microsoft, but that's just my preference.</p>
<br> 

<p>Online editors have also become popular in recent years. These editors run in your browser so there is no need to install anything on your computer. These online editors are nice because they can be accessed from anywhere, there drawback is they lack many of the advanced features that you get with desktop editors.</p> 
<p>Because of our current needs for virtual learning we will be using one of these online editors named <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Code Pen</a> for this course. This will prevent us from having to install and setup software on your computer, however, if you would prefer to use one of the desktop editors like Visual Studio Code, be my guest. Another popular online editor is named <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">JSFiddle</a>. You might want to check it out as well.</a>

<h3>Code Pen setup</h3>
<ol id="csList">
   <li><p>Type this URL in your browser, <strong>http:\\codepen.io</strong> or just click the following link: <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Code Pen</a>.</p></li>
   <li><p>Click on the green button "Sign Up for Free".</p></li>
   <li><p>When the next screen appears click on the button "Sign Up with Email".</p></li>
   <li><p>The screen will expand below the button so as to provide you with fields where you can type in your name, username, and email address (Use your school email). Finally select a password that you will remember and click on the green <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p></li>
   <li><p>Congratulation! You now have a Code Pen account, so login and look around.</p></li>
   <li><p><strong>Question:</strong> What is a pen? In Code Pen, a pen consists of three windows or Panels. One panel is for typing <strong>HTML</strong> code, a second panel is for adding some <strong>CSS</strong> code, and finally a third panel is for adding some <strong>Javascript</strong> code. You will learn about each of these as you work your way through the course.</p></li>
   <li><p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the difference between a project and a pen. In Code Pen, projects are more advanced and allow for multiple files of each of the three types. Since we are using the free version, you will not be able to create a project, so you will create <strong>pens</strong> instead, which will only allow you to have one file per panel. This means you can have a maximum of three files in a pen. One file for HTML, another for CSS, and a third for Javascript. This work for us since we typically don't need multiple files in a panel.</p></li>
