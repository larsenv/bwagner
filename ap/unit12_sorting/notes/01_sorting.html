<h1></h1>
<p>One of the fundamental problems of computer science is ordering a list of items. There's 
   an abundance of solutions to this problem, known as <strong>sorting algorithms</strong>. Some sorting algorithms
   are simple and intuitive, such as the selection sort. Others, such as the quick sort are extremely
   complicated, but produce lightening-fast results.</p>
<p>The common sorting algorithms can be divided into two classes by the complexity of their 
   algorithms. Algorithmic complexity is a complex subject that would take too
   much time to explain here, but suffice it to say that there's a direct correlation between
   the complexity of an algorithm and its relative efficiency. Algorithmic complexity is generally
   written in a form known as Big-O notation, where the O represents the complexity of the
   algorithm and a value n represents the size of the set the algorithm is run against. 
   Big-O provides a quantitative way of describing the run time or space efficiency of an
   algorithm. Big-O is independent of both the programming language and the computer used.</p>
   
<p>Below is a table showing some common Big-O descriptions:</p>

<p>The two classes of sorting algorithms are <strong>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</strong> or quadratic complexity, which
   includes algorithms like the bubble, insertion, and selection sorts; and <strong>O(n log n)</strong> which includes algorithms like the merge
   and quick sorts.</p>

<p>In addition to algorithmic complexity, the speed of the various sorts can be compared
   with empirical or experimental data. Since the speed of a sort can vary greatly depending on
   what data set it sorts, accurate empirical results require several runs of the sort be made
   and the results averaged together. The run times on your system will almost certainly vary
   from these results, but the relative speeds should be the same.</p>
   
<h1>AP Correlation</h1>
<p>Because of the large number of sorting algorithms available the AP Committee decided
   to limit the number of algorithms that a person taking the AP Exam is responsible for knowing
   to only three. These three are listed below.</p>

<h3>Slow Sorts</h3>

<p>- Selection Sort (n<sup>2</sup>)<br>
- Insertion Sort (n<sup>2</sup>)</p>

<h3>Fast Sorts</h3>
<p>- Merge Sort (n log n)</p>

<h1>IB Correlation</h1>
<p>IB has limited their curriculum to only two sorts.</p>

<h3>Slow Sorts</h3>

<p>- Bubble Sort (n<sup>2</sup>)<br>
- Selection Sort (n<sup>2</sup>)</p>



<h1>Sort Analyzer</h1>
<p>In discussing efficiency of an algorithm, we refer to the best case, worst case, and
   average case. The best case is a configuration of the data that causes the algorithm to run
   in the least possible amount of time. With sorting algorithms this often occurs when the data
   to be sorted is already sorted. The worst case is a configuration that leads to the greatest
   possible run time. With sorting algorithms this often occurs when the data to be sorted is
   sorted in reverse order. Typical configurations give the average case. With sorting algorithms
   this occurs when the data to be sorted is in random order. It is possible that best, worst,
   and average cases don't differ much in their run times.</p>

<p>Below is a javascript app that empirically tests the run-time efficiency of the different
   sorting algorithms. Each algorithm can be tested against the three cases: best case,
   worst case, and average case. For the best case we will examine the efficiency of the
   sorting algorithms when they sort an array that is already sorted. For the worst case
   we will examine them when they sort an array that is sorted in reverse order. For the 
   average case we will examine them when they sort an array that is in random order.</p>
