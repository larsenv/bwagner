<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>From Eliza in the 1960s to Siri and Watson today, the idea of talking to computers in natural language
has fascinated people. More and more, computer programs allow people to interact with them by typing
English sentences. The field of computer science that addresses how computers can understand human
language is called <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP).</strong></p>
<p>NLP is a field that attempts to have computers understand natural (i.e., human) language. There are
many exciting breakthroughs in the field. While NLP is a complicated field, it is fairly easy to create a
simple program to respond to English sentences.</p>
<p>For this lab, you will explore some of the basics of NLP. As you explore this, you will work with a variety
of methods of the <strong>String</strong> class and practice using the <strong>if</strong> statement. You will trace a complicated
method to find words in user input.</p>

<h1>What is a ChatBot?</h1>
<p>Chatbots are programs that are designed to respond like humans to natural language input. Before you
write code to create your own chatbot, you will explore some existing chatbots.</p>

<p>Click on the following links to see some chatbots - 
<a href="https://www.cleverbot.com/" style="color:#0000FF" target="_blank">CleverBot</a>&nbsp;
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/webtoolsbox/bots" style="color:#0000FF" target="_blank">ChatBots</a>

</p>
<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p>Choose one of the chatbots from the two sites referenced above and have several conversations with your chatbot and answer the following questions:</p>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>How does it respond to "where do you come from"?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most interesting response?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most peculiar response?</p></li>
<li><p>How does it respond to "asdfghjkl;"?</p></li>
</ol>
