<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>This question involves reasoning about a simulation of a frog hopping in a straight line. The frog attempts to hop to a goal within a specified number of hops. The simulation is encapsulated 
in the following <span class="cd">FrogSimulation</span> class. You will write two of the methods in this class.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>public class FrogSimulation { 
   /** Distance, in inches, from the starting position to the goal.*/ 
   <span id="apHighlight"><pre>private int goalDistance;</pre></span>

   /** Maximum number of hops allowed to reach the goal. */
   <span id="apHighlight"><pre>private int maxHops;</pre></span>

   /** Constructs a FrogSimulation where dist is the distance, in inches, 
    *    from the starting position to the goal, and numHops is 
    *    the maximum number of hops allowed to reach the goal. 
    *    Precondition: dist > 0; numHops > 0 
    */
   <span id="apHighlight"><pre>public FrogSimulation(int dist, int numHops)</pre></span>
   { 
      goalDistance = dist; 
      maxHops = numHops; 
   }

   /** 
    * Returns an integer representing the distance, 
    * in inches, to be moved when the frog hops.
    */ 
   <span id="apHighlight"><pre>private int hopDistance()</pre></span>
      {  /* implementation not shown */  } 

   /** 
    * Simulates a frog attempting to reach the goal 
    *   as described in part (a). 
    * Returns true if the frog successfully reached or
    *   passed the goal during the simulation; 
    *   false otherwise. 
    */
   <span id="apHighlight"><pre>public boolean simulate()</pre></span>
       {  /* to be implemented in part (a) */  }

   /** 
    * Runs num simulations and returns the proportion of
    *   simulations in which the frog successfully reached
    *   or passed the goal. 
    *   Precondition: num > 0 
    */
    <span id="apHighlight"><pre>public double runSimulations(int num)</pre></span>
       {  /* to be implemented in part (b) */  }
       
}</pre></div>


<h3>Part (a)</h3>
<p>Write the <span class="cd">simulate</span> method, which simulates the frog attempting to hop in a straight
line to a goal from the frog's starting position of 0 within a maximum number of hops. The method returns
<span class="cd">true</span> if the frog successfully reached the goal with in the maximum number of hops; otherwise, the method returns <span class="cd">false</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="cd">FrogSimulation</span> class provides a method called <span class="cd">hopDistance</span> that returns an integer 
representing the distance (positive or negative) to be moved when the frog hops. 
A positive distance represents a move toward the goal. A negative distance 
represents a move away from the goal. The returned distance may vary from call to call.
Each time the frog hops, its position is adjusted by the value returned by a
call to the <span class="cd">hopDistance</span> method.</p> 
<p>The frog hops until one of the following conditions becomes true:</p>
<ul id="csList">
<li><p>The frog has reached or passed the goal.</p></li>
<li><p>The frog has reached a negative position.</p></li>
<li><p>The frog has taken the maximum number of hops without reaching the goal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following example shows a declaration of a <span class="cd">FrogSimulation</span> object 
   for which the goal distance is 24 inches and the maximum number of hops is 5.
   The table shows some possible outcomes of calling the <span class="cd">simulate</span> method. </p>

<p>Complete method <span class="cd">simulate</span> below. You must use <span class="cd">hopDistance</span> appropriately to receive full credit.</p> 
<div id="apCode"><pre>
/** 
 * Simulates a frog attempting to reach the goal as 
 *   described in part (a). 
 * Returns true if the frog successfully reached or passed
 *   the goal during the simulation; false otherwise. 
 */
public boolean simulate()





</pre></div>

<h3>Part (b)</h3>
<p>Write the <span class="cd">runSimulations</span> method, which performs a given number of simulations
   and returns the proportion of simulations in which the frog successfully
   reached or passed the goal. For example, if the parameter passed to <span class="cd">runSimulations</span> 
   is 400, and 100 of the 400 simulate method calls returned <span class="cd"></span>true, then the
   <span class="cd">runSimulations</span> method should return 0.25.</p>
<p>Complete method <span class="cd">runSimulations</span> below. Assume that <span class="cd">simulate</span> works as specified, 
   regardless of what you wrote in part (a). You must use <span class="cd">simulate</span> 
   appropriately to receive full credit.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>
/** Runs num simulations and returns the proportion of simulations
 *    in which the frog successfully reached or passed the goal. 
 *    <strong>Precondition</strong>: num > 0 
 */
public double runSimulations(int num)
