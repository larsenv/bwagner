<div id="csContent"> 
<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Write a program that will allow a user to enter words from the keyboard until the word "stop"
     or "exit" is encountered. The program should also display a count of the number of words that were 
	 entered by the user, <strong>not</strong> including the sentinel value. (The word sentinel means to watch,
	 or guard. In Computer Science sentinel refers to the value your program is watching for inorder to
	 exit a loop. In this program "stop" and "exit" are sentinel values.)</p>


<h3>Comparing Strings </h3>
<p>Recall that when you want to compare two strings to see if they are equal you do not use the
 = = operator or the != operator. To compare strings use the <strong>equals</strong> method in the String class.</p>
<p>To check for not equal use code like the following:</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
!word.equals("stop") && !word.equals("exit") 
</pre>
</div>
<p>Notice the ! in front of each expression. It changes the equals into a not equals.</p>
<h3>Reading Strings </h3>
<p>Remember when reading strings from the keyboard use the next or nextLine methods.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
word = keyboard.nextLine();
</pre>
</div>
