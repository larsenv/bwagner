<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>In this exercise, you are going to sort an array of objects using the insertion sort algorithm. As you know from the unit on searching when you need to compare two objects to determine their ordering (alphabetical, numerical, etc), you cannot use the Java relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=). Instead you must use a method named the <strong>compareTo</strong> method.</p>

<div id="csCode"><pre>int result = object1.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>compareTo</pre>(object2);</pre></div>

<p>This method compares two objects and returns one of three integer values. It returns a negative number if object1 is less than the object2. It returns a positive number if object1 is greater than object2. And finally, it returns a zero if the two objects are equal. </p>



<p>It is the responsibility of the designer of a class to implement a <strong>compareTo</strong> method if they wish for there class to use this method to determine object ordering. In their implementation they must determine what it means for two objects to be equal and also what it means for one object to be less than or greater than another object. </p>

<p>For example, the String class implements a compareTo method. Two String objects are considered equal if they contain the same characters in the same sequence. A String object is consider to be less than another string if the character of the first string comes first in alphabetical order as compared to the second string. If the first character of each string are equal the compareTo method advances to the next characters in the strings and performs the comparison again. It continues to move down the strings character by character until either one pair of characters is not equal or the last character of one or both of the strings has been reached.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which character is less than the other, "a" or "A"? The answer is "A". The reason is the character "A" has an ordinal value of 65 on the ASCII chart, whereas the character "a" has an ordinal value of 97. 65 is less than 97.</p>

<h3>Implement compareTo method.</h3>
<p>The program in this exercise defines a class named <strong>Friend</strong>. This class declares four fields: lastName, firstName, phoneNumber, and birthdate. Write a compareTo method for this class that will 
first compare the lastName fields of two Friend objects. If the lastName fields are equal then compare the firstName field of the two objects, otherwise return the result of the first comparison.</p>

<p>Use the following pseudo code to implement the method:</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>Friend FRIEND = (Friend)OBJ
int RESULT = this.LASTNAME.compareTo(FRIEND.LASTNAME)
if RESULT = 0 then
   return this.FIRSTNAME.compareTo(FRIEND.FIRSTNAME)
else
   return RESULT
endif
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Implement sortFriends Method</h3>
<p>Implement the sortFriends method using the Selection Sort algorithm. Include the Friend class's <strong>compareTo</strong> method in your implementation.</p>
