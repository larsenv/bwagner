  <h1>Assignment Operator (=)</h1>
  <p>In Java, the equal sign (=) is called the <strong>assignment operator</strong>. The assignment operator is used to assign
     a value to a variable. Here are some examples.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
<div id="csComment"><pre>// declare variables</pre></div>
int integerValue;
double floatValue;
char charValue;

<div id="csComment"><pre>// assign values to variables</pre></div>
integerValue = 875;
floatValue = 28.975;
charValue = 'b';
</pre>
  </div>
<p>The assignment occurs from right to left. The value on the right is copied into the
   variable on the left.</p>
<p>The assign operator can be used to replace the contents of a variable with a new value.</p>
  <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
<div id="csComment"><pre>// declare variable</pre></div>
int num;

<div id="csComment"><pre>// assign values to variable</pre></div>
num = 0;
System.out.println(num);
num = 50;
System.out.println(num);
num = 225;
System.out.println(num);
</pre>
  </div>
<p>Here is the output. Notice how the variable's value changes each time the assignment
   operator is used.</p>
<div id="csOutput">
0<br>
50<br>
225<br>
</div>
<div id="csNote">
<strong>Programming Note:</strong> You can include comments in your code by placing them after two forward
slash symbols //. Here is an example from the code above. <br>
<br>
    <font color="#0000FF">// declare variable</font><br>
<br>
Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect program execution.</p>

</div>
<h1>Initialize Variable</h1>
<p>You can declare and assign a value to a variable at the same time. This is called <strong>initializing</strong> a variable.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int num = 500;
double price = 89.25;
</pre>
  </div>
<p>It is good practice to always initialize your variables when you declare them. If you don't
   know what the value for a variable should be when you declare it assign it the data type's default value.
   The default value for int and double is zero.</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int num = 0;
double price = 0;
</pre>
</div>
<p>You can declare multiple variables of the same type, on one line, by separating them with commas.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int game1, game2, game3;
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>You can initialize multiple variables of the same type, on one line, by separating them with commas.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int game1 = 5, game2 = 7, game3 = 12;
</pre>
  </div>
<h1>Variable Output</h1>
<p>To display the contents of a variable you simply include the variable name in a println
   statement without double quotes around it. If you place double quotes around the variable it
   will display the variable's name not its contents.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int average = 95;

System.out.println("average");
System.out.println(average);
</pre>
  </div>
<div id="csOutput">
average<br>
95<br>
</div>
<h1>Labeling Output</h1>
<p>The term <strong>user-friendly</strong> is often associated with computer software. A
   user-friendly program is one that is easy for a user to use and understand. One aspect of
   a user-friendly program is the way in which the output of the program is displayed on the screen.
   Look at the sample program below and the output produced.</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int temperature = 98;

System.out.println(temperature);
System.out.println();
System.out.println("The high temperature today is " + temperature);
</pre>
  </div>
  <div id="csOutput">
98<br>
<br>
The temperature today is 98<br>
</div>
<p>Which of the two output lines is more user-friendly. Well, obviously the second one, because it
   describes or labels the output so the user knows the values context. You should always strive
   to make your programs as user-friendly as possible.</p>
<h3>Concatenation Operator</h3>
<p>In Java, the plus sign (+) is used to label the data within a println statement. When the
   plus sign is used in this context it is referred to as the <strong>concatenation operator</strong>.
   Let's look at some examples.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int testGrade = 87;
int weight = 195;
double cost = 29.95;

System.out.println("Test grade = " + testGrade);
System.out.println("You can bench press " + weight + " pounds.");
System.out.println("The cost of the shirt is " + cost);
</pre>
  </div>
<div id="csOutput">
Test grade = 87<br>
You can bench press 195 pounds.<br>
The cost of the shirt is 29.95<br>
</div>
<p>The concatenation operator can also be used to provide spacing between data items.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 20;
int num3 = 30;

System.out.println(num1 + " " + num2 + " " + num3);
System.out.println(num1 + "     " + num2 + "     " + num3);
</pre>
  </div>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
10 20 30
10     20     30
</pre></div>
<br>
</div>
