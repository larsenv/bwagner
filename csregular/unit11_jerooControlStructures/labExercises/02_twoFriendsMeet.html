<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>One Saturday morning, two friends, Bugs and Daffy, decide to meet and plant flowers to beautify
     Santong island. Daffy starts in the Northwest corner facing East with 90 flowers in his pouch.
	 Bugs starts in the Northeast corner facing West with 90 flowers in his pouch. Bugs and Daffy
	 begin hopping toward one another. As they hop, each plants exactly one flower at every location
	 it enters, including its starting location. They meet, facing each other, roughly in the middle
	 of row 0. After a handshake and a little small talk, Bugs and Daffy both turn toward the south
	 and continue planting flowers all the way to the southern edge of the island. When both reach
	 the South Sea, the say goodbye and part. Daffy turns west and plants flowers all the way to the
	 Western Ocean. Bugs turns east and plants flowers all the way to the Eastern Ocean. This is 
	 where our story ends. Your task is to write a jeroo program that will illustrate this story.</p>
<p><strong>Programming Note:</strong>There are two different approaches you can use to solve this problem. One uses three while loops, and is
   easier; the other uses one while loop, and is more advanced.</p>
 <h3>Method plantAndHop</h3>  
   <p>Implement the method <strong>plantAndHop</strong> as described by its pre and post conditions below. Use this
   method in the implementation of your program.</p>
