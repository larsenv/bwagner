<div id="csContent"> 
<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Create a jeroo at (5,0), facing east, with 10 flowers in its pouch.</p>
  <p>The jeroo should travel from the east shoreline to the west shoreline.
     Whenever the jeroo encounters a complete horse-shoe shape made out of nets to its left,
     the jeroo should place a flower in the opening.</p>
  <p>The number of nets and the spacing between the nets is unknown.
     Your code should work no matter how the nets are arranged in rows 3 and 4.</p>
  <h3>Method turnAround</h3>
  <p>Write a method named <strong>turnAround</strong> as described by its pre and post conditions below.
     Use this method in your implementation of the program.</p>
 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
<font color="#FF00FF">// precondition:  none
// postcondition: The Jeroo has turned around and now is facing in the opposite direction.</font>
method turnAround()
{


}</pre>
</div>
