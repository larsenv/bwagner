<h1>Lesson</h1>
<p>In this lesson your will learn an important concept in html structure called <strong>display type</strong>.
   Most html tags fall into one of two display types or categories. These tags by default are either <strong>block</strong> type or
   <strong>inline</strong> type. Each display type has its own display properties.</p>
<h3>Block Type</h3>
<p>A <strong>block</strong> type element always starts on a new line and extends to take up the 
   full width of the window.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of block elements you have already used: p, pre, and h1-h6.</p> In this lesson, a new block tag is introduced called the
   <strong>div</strong> element. The div element is important because it is used as a container for other html elements.
<h3>Inline Type</h3>
<p>A <strong>inline</strong> type element does not start on a new line and will only take as much width as necessary.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of inline elements you have already used: a, br, strong, em, and img.</p>
 In this lesson, a new inline tag is introduced call the
    <strong>span</strong> element. The span element is used as a container for text. Combined with CSS it is often used to style parts of text.

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<ol id="csList">
<li><p>Open VSCode and create a new document named <strong>14_1_blocks.html</strong> and save it to your HTML folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Give the document the title: <strong>14_1_blocks</strong>.
<li><p>Add the necessary HTML starter code to your html document.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the following excerpt from Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech and paste it inside the
       body element of your HTML file.</p>
<div id="csHTML" style="width:850px"><pre>
&lt;p&gt;And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. 
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons
of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, 
sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged
by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream today!&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips
dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys
and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream today!&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low,
the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; "and the glory of the Lord 
shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."&lt;/p&gt;
