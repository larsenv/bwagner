<h1>Wireless Networking</h1>
<div id="ib">3.1.12 Outline the advantages and disadvantages of wireless networks.</div>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p><strong>Convenience</strong> - The wireless nature of such networks allows users to access network resources from nearly any convenient 
   location within their primary networking environment (a home or office). With the increasing saturation of laptop-style computers,
   this is particularly relevant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mobility</strong> - With the emergence of public wireless networks, users can access the internet even outside their normal work environment.
   Most chain coffee shops, for example, offer their customers a wireless connection to the internet at little or no cost.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Productivity</strong> - Users connected to a wireless network can maintain a nearly constant affiliation with their desired
   network as they move from place to place. For a business, this implies that an employee can potentially be more productive as his 
   or her work can be accomplished from any convenient location.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deployment</strong> - Initial setup of an infrastructure-based wireless network requires little more than a single access point.
   Wired networks, on the other hand, have the additional cost and complexity of actual physical cables being run to numerous locations
  (which can even be impossible for hard-to-reach locations within a building).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expandability</strong> - Wireless networks can serve a suddenly-increased number of clients with the existing equipment.
   In a wired network, additional clients would require additional wiring.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost</strong> - Wireless networking hardware is at worst a modest increase from wired counterparts. This potentially increased
   cost is almost always more than outweighed by the savings in cost and labor associated to running physical cables.</p></li>
</ul></div> 

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<div id="csList"><ul>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong> - To combat security issues, wireless networks may choose to utilize some of the various encryption technologies
   available. Some of the more commonly utilized encryption methods, however, are known to have weaknesses that a dedicated adversary can compromise.
   Novice home users may make themselves vulnerable by not utilizing proper security precautions when setting up a wireless network at home.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Range</strong> - The typical range of a common 802.11g network with standard equipment is on the order of tens of meters. While
   sufficient for a typical home, it will be insufficient in a larger structure. To obtain additional range, repeaters or additional
   access points will have to be purchased. Costs for these items can add up quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability</strong> - Like any radio frequency transmission, wireless networking signals are subject to a wide variety of interference.</p>
<li><p><strong>Speed</strong> -  (2018) The speed of wireless networks continues to improve with the lastest IEEEE standard 
    802.11ac reaching speeds up to 866.7 Mbps and the less expensive 802.11n version tops out at
    150 Mbps are still far slower than wired networks which have also seen speed boosts in recent years.
    The current IEEE 802.3bz standards for Ethernet are 2.5 Gbps for 2.5GBASE-T and 5 Gbps for 5GBASE-T. 
    It wonâ€™t be long until standard speeds will reach up to 10Gbps on a Cat6 cable. Cat5e can deliver speeds of 1 Gbps.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="csNote">Wireless networks have led to changes in working patterns, social activities and raised health issues.</div>

<div id="ib">3.1.13 Describe the hardware and software components of a wireless network.</div>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wireless router</strong>
  - A router is network device that determines where data packets should go and sends them to their destination by the shortest, 
    most efficient route. A <strong>wireless router</strong> is a router that uses radio waves to transmit data.</p>
	<div align="center"><img src="images/router.jpg"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Wireless adapter</strong> - A wireless network adapter connects a computer to a wireless network so that they can communicate.
  Virtually all laptop and smaller computing units come with a built-in wireless adapter. If you want to convert your desktop computer to a 
  wireless unit, you have to obtain a wireless adapter. The adapter slips into a slot inside the computer, with an antenna that projects out 
  the back of the computer. You can also buy adapters that plug into a usb port.</p>

  </table>
  
  </div>
  
  </li>
<li><p><strong>Extender</strong>
- Wireless networks have a finite range. If you find that your signal is not strong enough to cover the areas you want, a wireless extender 
  can fix the problem. A wireless extender captures the router signal and rebroadcasts it. Plug your extender into a wall socket about 
  halfway between the router and where you are having difficulty picking up the wireless signal.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p><strong>Router Software</strong> - routers contain built-in software that can be accessed using any web browser software. This software
     is used to configure the router. You can perform tasks like assigning a router's SSID and setting security and firewall parameters.</p>
	 
<div id="csNote">A <strong>SSID</strong> is a unique name given to a wireless network that is broadcast so that clients can connect to it. 
 Each packet sent over a wireless network includes the SSID, which ensures that the data being sent over the air arrives at the correct location.</div>

<div id="ib">3.1.14 Describe the characteristics of wireless networks.</div>

<h3>WiFi</h3>
<ul id="csList">
<li><p>Wireless network that uses radio waves to transmit and receive data.</p></li>
<li><p>Effect range relatively short, about 65 ft.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently has higher average data speeds compared to other wireless network technologies (WiMax, LTE).</p></li>
<li><p>Speed is effected by interference and distance from router.</p></li>
<li><p>Easy setup.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)</h3>
<div id="csList">
<li><p>It is similar to Wi-Fi, but it can enable usage at much greater distances.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a wireless alternative to cable, DSL, and satellite Internet service. It is essentially a wireless broadband.</p></li>
<li><p>ISPs can deliver Internet connections without running expensive cables to every home, and speeds often run between 5-10Mbps.</p></li>
<li><p>Primarily due to its much higher cost, WiMAX is not a replacement for Wi-Fi home networking or Wi-Fi hotspot technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>Current WiMax availability is limited.</p></li>
<li><p>WiMax lost out to the competing LTE technology in the cell phone industry.</p></li>
</div>

<h3>LTE (Long Term Evolution)</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p>Technology adopted by majority of mobile carriers.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses packet switching technology for both data and voice.</p></li>
<li><p>Capable of 300Mbps download speeds and 75Mbps upload speeds.</p></li>
<li><p>Most 4G networks use this technology.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>3G mobile</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p>"3rd Generation" cell phone technology first avaliable in cell phones in 2003.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending upon carrier 3G networks use either EDGE, EV-DO or HSPA data protocols.</p></li>
<li><p>Speeds range between 400 kilobits and 2Mbps, depending on the carrier and region.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>4G mobile</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><p>"4rd Generation" cell phone technology first avaliable in cell phones in 2008.</p></li>

<li><p>Speeds currently range between 3.5Mbps and 19Mbps, depending on the carrier and region.</p></li>
<li><p>There is currently very little standardization in 4G technologies. In some cases, one company's 4G speeds could
       be inferior to another carrier's older 3G network.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3>Future Networks</h3>

<ul id="csList">
<li><p><strong>LTE-Advanced (Long Term Evolution-Advanced)</strong>  is the next generation cellular networking standard that offers higher throughput than its predecessor, LTE standard.</p></li>
<li><p>LTE-Advanced networks can deliver up to 1 GBps of data, compared to a maximum of 300 MBps over LTE networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses multiple-input, 
multiple-output (MIMO) technology to deliver data faster via more than one signal. MIMO requires multiple antennas to receive those signals, which can limit its use
in compact mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="ib">3.1.15 Describe the different methods of network security.</div>
<p>There are several methods used to provide security for a wireless networking. The most common ones are encryption, authentication, and MAC address filtering.</p>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>Encryption is the process of encoding data sent wirelessly between your device and the router, essentially
   scrambling the information and restricting open access. There are three main types of encryption: WEP, WPA, and WPA2.</p>

<div id="csList">
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)</strong> - is an older network security method from the late 1990's that is still available to support older devices, 
   but it is no longer recommended. When you enable WEP, you set up a network security key. This key encrypts the information that
   one computer sends to another computer across your network. However, WEP security is relatively easy to crack.
   </p></li>
   <li><p><strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)</strong> - first used in 2003 to improve on or replace the flawed WEP encryption. WPA provides much 
    stronger encryption than WEP and addresses a number of WEP weaknesses.</p></li>
   <li><p><strong>WPA2</strong> - in 2006 WPA2 replaced WPA to again improve security by requiring use of stronger wireless encryption than what WPA requires.
    Specifically, WPA2 does not allow use of an algorithm called TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) that has known security holes (limitations)
    in the original WPA implementation. WPA2 uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which provides government-grade encryption capabilities that
    are stronger than the TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) used by WPA. In fact, AES is thought to be uncrackable by even the most skilled hacker.</p></li>
  </ul>
</div> 

<h3>Authentication</h3> 
<p>Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be. In a wireless network authentication 
   is commonly done through the use of logon passwords or passphrases.</p>
<p>WPA/WPA2 utilize two different protocols for network authentication.</p>
	<div id="csList"><ul>
	<li><p><strong>WPA2-PSK</strong> is intended for home and very small office networks. Each wireless device is authenticated by the same 256-bit
	   key. With this mode, you set an encryption passphrase that must be entered by each user when connecting to the network. This passphrase can be
	   stored on each computer, but it must be entered for each device. All users share a locally stored passphrase, which can
	   be found and copied from a computer by anyone. This makes WPA2-PSK less secure than the WPA2-ENT mode.</p>
     <li><p><strong>WPA2-ENT</strong> is made for the enterprise network, but it's a smart choice for any business network. It provides
	   security against more attacks than WPA2-PSK and separates users from the router's passphrase to the network. WPA2-ENT creates new encryption
	   keys each time users log on to the network with their unique passwords, and the passphrase to the network is not stored locally. It also 
	   allows for centralized control over users' access to the wireless network, which makes management easier than with the WPA2-PSK mode.</p></li>	
	</ul></div>
   
<h3>MAC Address Filtering</h3>

<p>A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network adapter by the manufacturer for identification.</p>
<p>MAC address filtering allows only machines with specific MAC addresses access to a network. You specify which addresses are allowed in 
   the router software.</p>

<div id="csNote">Wireless networks have led to concerns about the security of the user's data.</div>


<div id="ib">3.1.16 Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method of network security.</div>

<p>MAC Address filtering will discourage the casual user from accessing your network but it will do very little to deter knowledgeable hackers who can use
   software to scan for MAC Addresses of legitimate devices currently accessing your network and then spoof their own MAC into a validated one.</p>

<p>The best way to secure a wireless network is combine both encryption and authentication technology using the WPA2 standard. However, for authentication to be
   effective a <strong>strong password</strong> must be used.</p>
