<p>An <strong>APLine</strong> is a line defined by the equation ax + by + c = 0 , where a is not equal to zero,
   b is not equal to zero, and a, b, and c are all integers. The slope of an APLine is defined 
   to be the double value -a / b . A point (represented by integers x and y) is on an APLine if
   the equation of the APLine is satisfied when those x and y values are substituted into the
    equation. That is, a point represented by x and y is on the line if ax + by + c is equal to
   0. Examples of two APLine equations are shown in the following table</p>
   
   <table id="csTable">
        <tr> 
          <th>Equation</th>
          <th>Slope (&#8211;a / b)</th>
          <th>Is point (5, -2) on the line?</th>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>5x + 4y - 17 = 0</td>
          <td>-5 / 4 = -1.25</td>
          <td>Yes, because 5(5) + 4(-2) + (-17) = 0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>-25x + 40y + 30 = 0</td>
          <td>25 / 40 = 0.625</td>
          <td>No, because -25(5) + 40(-2) + 30 ? 0</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

<p>Assume that the following code segment appears in a class other than APLine. The code segment shows an
example of using the APLine class to represent the two equations shown in the table.</p>

<div id="apCode" style="width:670px">
<pre>
APLine line1 = new APLine(5, 4, -17);
double slope1 = line1.getSlope(); // slope1 is assigned -1.25
boolean onLine1 = line1.isOnLine(5, -2); // true because 5(5) + 4(-2) + (-17) = 0

APLine line2 = new APLine(-25, 40, 30);
double slope2 = line2.getSlope(); // slope2 is assigned 0.625
boolean onLine2 = line2.isOnLine(5, -2); // false because -25(5) + 40(-2) + 30 != 0
</pre>
</div>

<p>Write the <strong>APLine</strong> class. Your implementation must include a constructor that
   has three integer parameters that represent a, b, and c, in that order. You may assume that 
   the values of the parameters representing a and b are not zero. It must also include a method 
   getSlope that calculates and returns the slope of the line, and a method isOnLine that returns
   true if the point represented by its two parameters (x and y, in that order) is on the APLine
   and returns false otherwise. Your class must produce the indicated results when invoked by
   the code segment given above. You may ignore any issues related to integer overflow.</p>
