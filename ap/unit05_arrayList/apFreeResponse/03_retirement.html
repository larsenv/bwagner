<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Periodically, a company processes the retirement of some of its employees. In this question, you will write methods to help the
   company determine whether an employee is eligible to retire and to process the retirement of all eligible employees.</p>
 
<p>The Employee class is declared as follows.</p>
 <div id="apCode"><pre>
public class Employee
{
    // returns the age (in years) of this employee
    <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public int getAge()</pre></div>
 
    // returns the number of years this employee has worked
    <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public int getYearsOnJob()</pre></div>
 
    // returns the salary of this employee in dollars
    <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public double getSalary()</pre></div>
 
    // returns unique employee ID number
    <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public int getID()</pre></div>
 
    // ... constructor, other member methods and data not shown.
}
</pre></div> 
The Company class is declared as follows.
 <div id="apCode"><pre>
public class Company
{
   // minimum age to retire
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public static final int RETIRE_AGE = 65;</pre></div>
 
   // minimum years on job to retire 
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public static final int RETIRE_YEARS = 20;</pre></div>
 
   // minimum salary to retire
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public static final double RETIRE_SALARY = 50000;</pre></div>
    
   // empList.size() is the number of employees in this company   
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>private ArrayList&lt;Employee&gt; empList;</pre></div>
 
   // total salary of all employees
 
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>private double salaryBudget;</pre></div> 
 
   // postcondition: returns true if emp is eligible to
   // retire; otherwise, returns false
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>private boolean employeeIsEligible(Employee emp)</pre></div> 
   { /* to be implemented in part (a) */}
   
   
   // postcondition: all retirement-eligible employees have
   // been removed from empList; empList has been resized
   // to reflect retirements; empList remains sorted
   // by employee ID; salaryBudget has been updated
   // to reflect remaining employees
   <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public void processRetirements()</pre></div> 
   { /* to be implemented in part (b) */}
 
 
   // ... constructors and other public members not shown
} 
</pre></div>

<p>The data member empList is sorted in ascending order by employee ID. The total of all salaries is maintained in the data member salaryBudget.</p>

<div id="csList2">
<ol>
<li>
<p>An employee is eligible for retirement if (s)he meets at least two of the following requirements:</p> 
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The employee is at least retireAge years old.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The employee has worked for at least retireYears.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The employee's salary is at least retireSalary.</p>

<p>Write the Company member method <strong>employeeIsEligible</strong>, which is described as follows. 
employeeIsEligible returns a Boolean value that indicates whether Employee emp is eligible
for  retirement, using the rules described above.</p>
 
<p>Complete method <strong>EmployeeIsEligible</strong> below.</p>
<div id="apCode" style="width:550px"><pre>// postcondition: returns true if emp is eligible to
// retire; otherwise, returns false
<div id="apHighlight"><pre>private boolean employeeIsEligible(Employee emp)</pre></div>


</pre></div></li> 
 
<br><br> 
<li><p>Write the Company member method <strong>processRetirements</strong>, which is described as follows.
 processRetirements removes all retirement-eligible employees from the empList array, resizes (shrinks) empList 
 as appropriate (maintaining its order by employee ID), and decreases salaryBudget to reflect the salary of the remaining employees.</p>
 
<p>In writing processRetirements, you may call <strong>employeeIsEligible</strong>, specified in part (a).
 Assume that employeeIsEligible works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a).</p>
 
<p>Complete method <strong>processRetirements</strong> below.</p>
<div id="apCode" style="width:550px"><pre>// postcondition: all retirement-eligible employees have
// been removed from empList; empList has been resized
// to reflect retirements; empList remains sorted
// by employee ID; salaryBudget has been updated
// to reflect remaining employees
<div id="apHighlight"><pre>public void processRetirements()</pre></div>
