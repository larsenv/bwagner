<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>A Jeroo starts at the southwest corner of the island, location (23,0), facing East with
     no flowers. There is a flower somewhere east of the Jeroo. There are zero or more hurdles,
	 represented by nets, between the Jeroo and the flower. Each hurdle is a rectangular
	 arrangement of nets with its base along the Southern Sea. The height and width of each hurdle
	 is unknown. The number of hurdles and the spacing between the hurdles is unknown. There is 
	 at least one row of empty cells along the top and sides of each hurdle. There are no water
	 features and no other Jeroos on the island. The only nets are those that define the hurdles.
	 The goal of this program is to have the Jeroo scale or outline all of the nets and stop on top of the flower. </p>
