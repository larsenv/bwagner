<h1>Planning and System Installation</h1>
<div id="ib">1.1.1 Identify the context for which a new system is planned.</div>
<p>When organizations are designing a new computer system they often start by identifying the information
   that needs to be input into the system and the information that will be produced or output by the system.
   By identifying these two areas designers are given a better picture of the scope and limitations of the new system.</p>
<p>Some of the organizational issues that must be considered when installing a new system include things such as
   needs, limitations, user roles, cost, underlying technologies.</p>

<div id="csNote">
<strong>Computer systems analysts</strong> create new computer systems by studying an organization's current computer systems and procedures and making recommendations
to help the organization operate more efficiently and effectively. They bring business and information
technology (IT) together by understanding the needs and limitations of both.
</div>
<br>
<div id="ib">1.1.2 Describe the need for change management.</div>
<p>In the area of technology, <strong>change management</strong> refers to a set of standardized processes for keeping all IT (Information Technology) 
   systems in good working order. </p>

<p><strong>Reasons why change management is needed</strong></p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Accomplishes change in the most efficient manner while minimizing the impact on an organization.</li>
<li>Provides  training and support for staff.</li>
<li>Ensures that a consistent approach to change is used.</li>
<li>Ensures that proper planning, designing, and testing of proposed change has occurred.</li>
<li>Lowers the total cost of IT services.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="ib">1.1.3 Outline compatibility issues resulting from situations including legacy systems or business mergers.</div>
<p>A <strong>legacy system</strong> is an outdated computer system, programming language or application software that is used
  instead of available upgraded versions. A legacy system is often still in use because its data cannot be changed to newer 
  or standard formats, or its application programs cannot be upgraded.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy system compatibility issues</strong></p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Will legacy software run on new hardware?</li>
<li>Is the format of the legacy system data compatible with new software?</li>
<li>Can the legacy system be used with new technologies?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Business merger compatibility issues</strong></p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Is the data from each company compatible?</li>
<li>How is the data from each system going to be integrated?</li>
<li>Transformation of data from one system to another.</li>
<li>Companies may not be using same application software.</li>
<li>Businesses may not have same change management policies.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="ib">1.1.4 Compare the implementation of systems using a client's hardware with hosting systems remotely.</div>

<p><strong>Client Hardware</strong></p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Must buy and maintain servers</li>
<li>Must buy and maintain software</li>
<li>Need employees to support hardware and software</li>
<li>Need more building space to house servers</li>
<li>Cost of electricity to operate hardware</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Hosting System remotely (Cloud)</strong></p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Don't have to buy hardware or software</li>
<li>Don't need as many employees to support technology</li>
<li>Only pay for the amount of resources used (bandwidth and server space)</li>
<li>Easy to deploy</li>
<li>Improve efficiency through virtual pooling of available resources</li>
<li>Round the clock support</li>
<li>Employees can access resources from virtually anywhere</li>
</ul>
</div>


<p><strong>Local Computing</strong> means storing and accessing data and programs stored on your computer or a server at your location.</p>
  <p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong> means storing and accessing data and programs 
    over the <strong>Internet</strong> instead of your computer's hard drive. 
    Examples of cloud computing include Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Amazon Cloud 
    Drive, and Microsoft oneDrive.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/cloud1.jpg" width="50%" height"50%"></div>

<p>One type of service cloud computing provides to businesses is SaaS.
<strong>SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)</strong> is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are centrally hosted on the <strong>cloud</strong>. 
SaaS is typically accessed by users using a web browser. Examples of Saas include Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Pandora, Google Docs, and any one of the many email clients.</p>

<strong>Benefits of the SaaS include</strong>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>easier administration</li>
<li>automatic updates and patch management</li>
<li>compatibility: All users will have the same version of software.</li>
<li>global accessibility.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="csNote">The traditional model of software distribution, in which software is purchased for and installed
   on personal computers, is sometimes referred to as <strong>SaaP (Software-as-a-Product)</strong>.</div>

<div id="ib">1.1.5 Evaluate alternative installation processes.</div>
<p>When a new system is introduced it will often mean changes in the way things are done. The method of installation will have an
   impact on how these changes are received. Below are four different methods for introducing a new system.</p>

<h3>Direct Changeover</h3>
<p>In the direct changeover approach the entire system is replaced in an instant. This type of changeover carries the
   most risk because; if something goes wrong, reverting back to the old system usually is impossible. Using the direct changeover
   technique tends to work best in situations where a system failure isn't critical enough to result in a disaster for the company.
   In this case the users need to be trained completely before the changeover takes place. An example of direct changeover would be
   a supermarket that closed for one night, all the old checkouts taken out, the new ones installed and the supermarket reopens the next day.</p>
<h3>Parallel Changeover</h3>
<p>In a parallel changeover, the new system runs simultaneously with the old for a given period of time. Of all the techniques, this
   tends to be the <strong>most  popular</strong>, mainly because it carries the lowest risk. If something goes wrong at any point, the entire system can
   be reverted back to its original state. A primary disadvantage in running two systems at the same time is higher costs. The parallel
   changeover approach can also be quite time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Phased Changeover</h3>
<p>The phased changeover technique is considered a compromise between parallel and direct changeovers. In a phased changeover,
   the new system is implemented one stage at a time. As an example, consider a company working toward installing a new financial 
   system. Implementing the new system one department at a time, the company converts accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll,
   and so on. Advantages to phased changeovers are their low cost and isolated errors. The main disadvantage is the process takes a
   long time to complete because phases need to be implemented separately.</p>

<h3>Pilot Changeover</h3>
<p>With a pilot changeover, the new system is tried out at a test site before launching it company-wide. For example, a bank 
  may first test the system at one of its branches. This branch is referred to as the pilot, or beta, site for the program. Since
  parallel changeovers tend to be expensive, using the pilot changeover technique allows companies to run the new system next to
  their old but on a much smaller scale. This makes the pilot changeover method much more cost-effective. After the kinks are worked
  out of the system at the test site, companies usually opt to use the direct changeover technique to launch the system company-wide.</p>
	
<div id="ib">1.1.6 Discuss problems that may arise as a part of data migration.</div>

<p><strong>Data Migration</strong> refers to the process of transferring data from an old system to a new system. Below are some of
  the common problems that can can occur during this transfer.</p>

<h3>Incomplete Data</h3>
<p>Data can be missing partially or completely. For instance if some field values are null and during migration process
   these were not handled in elegant manner, could cause lot of problems in proper functioning of the migrated system.</p>

<h3>Duplicate Data</h3>
<p>Multiple instances of the same data is a big problem during data migration. It's unlikely that conversion will ignore
   duplicate data records. Since the data format is different in each of the duplicate records, though the information is
   the same, it is difficult to narrow down and ignore duplicate data records.</p>
<h3>Data Non-conformity</h3>
<p>This is because the way the data in the database is formatted differs greatly from individual to individuals who
   have created the database structure. Hence data is not present in the standard format.</p>
<h3>Inconsistent and Inaccurate Data</h3>
<p>When merging various systems, the data can lack consistency and represent wrong information. Data deteriorates over time,
   which can cause a lot of difficulties during migration.</p>

<p>Other issues include incompatible file formats, data structures, validation rules, incomplete data transfer and 
   <strong>international conventions</strong> on dates, currencies, and character sets.</p>


<div id="ib">1.1.7 Suggest various types of testing.</div>
<p>System testing refers to a series of tests whose primary purpose is to fully exercise the new computer system.
 Although each test has a different purpose, all work to verify that system elements have been properly integrated and perform
 as expected. Testing occurs at every stage of system implementation.</p>

<p>The types of system tests include</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit Test</strong> - this involves the testing of each individual module with test data to see if it's works as planned</li>

<li><strong>System Test</strong> - this involves testing the overall function performance of the system. This test often involves using software that can
  test other software, thereby automating parts of the testing process and reducing costs.</li>

<li><strong>Recovery Test</strong> - this test forces the software to fail in a variety of ways and verifies that recovery is properly performed.</li>

<li><strong>Security Test</strong> - this test attempts to verify that protection mechanisms built into a system will, in fact, protect it from improper access.</li>

<li><strong>Stress Test</strong> - this test executes a system in a manner that demands resources in abnormal quantity, frequency, or volume.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>There is testing that is specific to software deployment.</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Test</strong> - is the first phase of testing in a software development process. The first phase includes unit testing and system testing. </li>
<li><strong>Beta Test</strong> - is the second phase of software testing in which a sampling of the intended audience tries the product out.  Beta testing can be considered "pre-release testing."</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div align="center"><img src="images/betaTesting1.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"></div>
<h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>
<p>The site referenced by the link below explains the different phases of testing, specifically acceptance testing, very well.
   It is a must read.</p>

<br><br>
<h1>User Focus</h1>
<div id="ib">1.1.8 Describe the importance of user documentation.</div>
<p><strong>User documentation</strong> is intended to help the users of the system. The users are usually non-technical people,
   who don't need to know how the system works. They just need to know how to use it.</p>
<p>The quality of user documentation can affect the rate of implementation of the new system.</p>

<p><strong>User documentation</strong> usually includes:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>List of minimum hardware and software required to use the system</li>
<li>How to install the system</li>
<li>How to start / stop the system</li>
<li>How to use the features of the system</li>
<li>Screenshots showing the system in typical use</li>
<li>Example inputs and outputs</li>
<li>Explanations of any error messages that might be shown</li>
<li>A troubleshooting guide</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="ib">1.1.9 Evaluate different methods of providing user documentation.</div>
<p>There are several methods used to provide user documentation. They include:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>User Guides and Manuals</li>
<li>Help Files</li>
<li>Online Support</li>
<li>Online Tutorials</li>
<li>FAQ</li>

</div>

<div id="ib">1.1.10 Valuate different methods of delivering user training.</div>
<p>There are several methods used to provide training for users of a new system. They include:</p>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Instructor-led training (seminars)</li>
<li>Web-based training (self-paced)</li>
<li>Web-conferencing</li>
<li>Self-study (reference material)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h1>System Backup</h1>

<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Inability to read unknown file formats</li>
</ul></div>
<h3>Failure</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Power failure - resulting in data in volatile memory not being saved to permanent memory</li>
<li>Hardware failure - such as a hard disk crash</li>
<li>Software failure - system crash or freeze, resulting in data not being saved in permanent memory</li>
<li>Data corruption - such as file-system corruption or database corruption</li>
</ul></div>
<h3>Disaster</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Natural disasters - tornado, hurricane, earthquake, flood, etc.</li>
<li>Fire</li>
</ul></div>
<h3>Crime</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li>Theft, hacking - sabotage, etc.</li>
<li>A malicious act - such as a worm, virus, hacker or theft of physical media</li>
</ul></div>


<div id="ib">1.1.12 Outline the consequences of data loss in a specified situation.</div>

<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><strong>Client Data</strong> - Artwork in digital format, usually backed up on removable media such as DVD or CD</li>
<li><strong>Internal Process Data</strong> - Internal forms, from general applications for employment to work requests, usually on a local server or machine</li>
<li><strong>Customer Accounting Data</strong> - Invoicing, general accounting of receivables and payables, includes tax documents, usually kept on a local server or machine</li>
<li><strong>Customer Relationship Management</strong> - Who your customers are, where they are located and how they interact with you, usually kept on a local server or machine</li>
<li><strong>Marketing Materials</strong> - Brochures, flyers, print advertisements, web-site originals, usually kept on a local server or machine</li>
<li><strong>Correspondence</strong> - Email storage, usually kept on a local server or machine.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Losing data can lead to businesses ceasing to function, in some
cases, such as the loss of a file, it is an inconvenience resulting in lost productivity
while the file is recreate. The loss of a customer database could potentially
put a business out of business.</p>

<div id="ib">1.1.13 Describe a range of methods that can be used to prevent data loss.</div>
<p>A <strong>backup</strong> is a copy of your data, stored to prevent it from being lost or stolen.</p>
<h3>Preventing Personal Data Loss</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><strong>Removable Media</strong> such CDs, DVDs, USB drives, or external hard drives are often used to store 
   backups of personal files.</li> 
<li><strong>Online Backup</strong> is a service managed by software usually installed on a PC to save
files on a remote server via a secure internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Virus-protection Software</strong> - use virus detection programs and keep them updated.</li>
<li>Run <strong>utility software</strong> that can detect potential problems with a hard drive.</li>
</ul></div>
<h3>Preventing Data Loss in an Organization or Business</h3>
<div id="csList">
<ul>
<li><strong>Failover or Redundancy System</strong> - involves invoking a secondary system to take over when the primary system fails. 
   Up-to-date copies of all required data and applications are maintained on the secondary system in order to
   respond immediately if the primary system becomes unusable.</li>   
<li><strong>Online Backup Service</strong> - A remote, online, or managed backup service, sometimes marketed as cloud backup, is a 
   service that provides users with a system for the backup, storage, and recovery of computer files. Online backup providers
   are companies that provide this type of service to clients.</li> 
</ul></div>
<h1>Software Deployment</h1>
<div id="ib">1.1.14 Describe strategies for managing releases and updates.</div>

<p>A <strong>patch</strong> is a piece of software designed to fix problems with, or update a computer program or
   its supporting data. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, and improving the usability or performance.</p>

<p>Because the word patch carries the connotation of a small fix, large fixes or patches that significantly change a
   program may circulate as <strong>service packs</strong> or as <strong>software updates</strong>.</p>

<p>Users can check periodically for updates on software websites and install manually or they can setup automatic updates so
  the software downloads and installs automatically.</p>
