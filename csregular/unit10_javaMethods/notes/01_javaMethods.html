  <h1>Jeroo Methods Review</h1>
  <p>Recall that a <strong>method</strong> is a collection of statements that are written in
	 a programming language to describe a specific behavior. Creating a method in Jeroo was a two-step 
	 process.</p> 
	 <div id="csList">
	    <ol>
		   <li>Define and name the new behavior (give the method a name).</li>
		   <li>Write the source code for the method.</li>
		</ol>
	 </div>
   <p>Here is the definition of one of the Jeroo methods we created.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
method turnAround()
{
   turn(RIGHT);
   turn(RIGHT);
}</pre>
   </div>
<p>To use this new Jeroo behavior in your program you used code like the following.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
method main()
{
   Jeroo bob = new Jeroo();
   bob.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>turnAround</pre></div>();
}</pre>
   </div>
<p>In this lesson, we look at how methods are created and used in Java. Java, being a general-purpose
   language, has a higher level of complexity than Jeroo when it comes to method creation and use.
   It will, therefore, take us several units to cover this topic thoroughly.</p>
<h1>Java Methods</h1>
<p>The Java programs we have seen up until now have all been fairly small. When you try to develop
   much larger programs, you will soon realize that the difficulty of doing this becomes much
   greater - mostly because there seems to be so much to remember, or to have to think about at each
   stage.</p>
   
   <p>The human mind is often not very good at being able to deal with a large number of 
   concepts or problems at any one instant. (Think about it: How easy is it for you to read a list
   of only three numbers and remember them all? How easy is it to read a list of sixty random
   numbers and remember them all?) The human mind is, however, very good at being able to see 
   patterns in large structures, and to use these patterns to help manage complexity. (Think about
   it: Suppose you were given a list of three thousand consecutive odd numbers and asked to remember
   them all. You would be able to achieve this easily, not by brute force, but from remembering a
   very simple pattern and only two numbers - the first and the last).</p>
  
   <p>For this reason - namely, that humans need to exploit patterns and smaller structures to be
   able to handle potentially enormous problems - large programs are conveniently developed, not as
   one single, long, algorithm, but as a collection of smaller pieces which we call <strong>methods</strong>.
   
   <p>In fact, we have been using this idea all along, except that we have made use only of predefined
      library methods. These form part of a system that is supplied with any programming language's
	  compiler, which in Java is often described by an API or application programming interface. 
	  These methods make it easy to perform commonly required tasks like "read an integer value"
	  or "generate a random number". Here are some the methods we have used so far.</p>
	<div id="csCode">
	<pre>
keyboard.nextInt()
keyboard.nextDouble()
Math.sqrt(81)
Math.random()
str1.equals(str2)
str.length()</pre>
	</div>
	
  <h1>Create Java Methods</h1>
  <p>Creating a method in Java is similar to the process we used to create a method in Jeroo. To 
     create a Java method, you must write a definition, which consists of a header and a body.
     The <strong>method header</strong>, which appears at the beginning of a method definition, lists several
	 important things about the method, including the method's name.
     The <strong>method body</strong> is a collection of statements that are performed when the method is executed.
 </p>
  <p>Look at the following illustration that describes the different parts of a Java method.</p>

        </ul>
    </div>

	<h1>Problem Decomposition</h1>
	<p>Problem Decomposition (also know as Top-down Design or Step-wise Refinement) is a problem solving strategy used to decrease the complexity
	    a programming task by breaking it down into smaller subtasks. Each subtask is sub-divided until a manageable level is achieved.</p>
	 <p>Once a problem has been satisfactorily decomposed a program can be written whose structure
	    reflects the sub-problem hierarchy. In Java, this structure is achieved through the constructing
		of <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>methods</strong>.</p>
	 <h3>Class Decomposition</h3>
	 <p>Classes represent the highest level of decomposition. You are already familiar with classes
		since all the Java code we have written so far was contained in a class. You have also used
		some of Java's standard library classes such as String, Scanner, and Math. Applying Class Decomposition
		involves breaking a problem up into multiple classes where each class has a specific task
		in solving the problem. We will look more closely at classes and how they can be used to
		decompose a problem in another unit. </p>
	 <h3>Method Decomposition</h3>	
	 <p>Methods represent a lower level of decomposition because each subtask of the problem can
	    typically be coded as a single method. The following example will demonstrate this
		process.</p>
	 <br>
	 <h1>Program - Calculate Slope of a Line</h1>
	 <h3>Problem Description</h3>
	 <p>Steve is taking Algebra 1 this year and his class is currently doing a unit on linear
	    equations. Steve is also taking Computer Science this year and has some 
		experience programming in Java. The lesson they are doing in Algebra right now involves
		calculating the slope of line given two points on the line. Steve has decided to write
		a program that will calculate the slope for him. He knows the formula for calculating
		slope is m = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>).</p>
	 <h3>Structure Chart</h3>
	 <p>A <strong>structure chart</strong> (hierarchy chart) is a graphic depiction of the
	   decomposition of a problem. Below is a structure chart for Steve's problem.</p>
	 <div align="center"><img src="images/calculateSlope.png"></div>
	 <p>Steve has decomposed his problem into three subtasks. The first task is to get the (x,y) values
	    for the two points from the keyboard. The second task is to calculate the slope using slope formula.
		The third task is to print the results of the calculation.</p>
	 <h3>Method Decomposition</h3>
	 <p>Following the structure of his chart, Steve's program will have one class named SlopeCalculator and the
	    class will contain three methods named <strong>getPoints</strong>, <strong>calculateSlope</strong>,
	    and <strong>printResults</strong>.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Write Program</h1>
	<h3>Step 1 - Create Stub Program</h3>
	<p>A <strong>stub program</strong> is a program that contains small pieces of code, called stubs, 
	   used to form the skeleton of a program. A stub is often a method declaration with no code inside
	   or simple code that includes print statements used to identify each method when the program is executed.
	   Stubs allow a programmer to create the basic structure of a program without worrying about
	   the details of the algorithms that will eventually be part of the program.</p>
	 <p>Steve starts by creating a stub program for the problem including the class SlopeCalculator and
	    the three methods getPoints, calculateSlope, and printResults. He includes println statements
		in each method so he can check the flow of the program when it is executed. He can remove the
		println statements later if he chooses.</p>
	<div id="csCode">
	   
    <pre>
import java.util.*;

public class SlopeCalculator
{
    // Precondition: none
    // Postcondition: values of two points have been
    //     retrieved from keyboard
    public void <div id="csHighlight"><pre>getPoints</pre></div>()
    {
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println("     getPoints");
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Precondition: none
    // Postcondition: slope has been calculated
    public void <div id="csHighlight"><pre>calculateSlope</pre></div>()
    {
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println("   calculateSlope");
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Precondition: none
    // Postcondition: displayed slope
    public void <div id="csHighlight"><pre>printResults</pre></div>()
    {
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println("    printResults");
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        SlopeCalculator app = new SlopeCalculator();
        app.getPoints();
        app.calculateSlope();
        app.printResults();
    }
}	   
	   </pre>
	</div>
<p>Here is the output for the stub program. The output allows Steve to 
   verify that the flow of the program is as expected.</p>
   <div id="csOutput">
   <pre>
/********************/
     getPoints
/********************/  

/********************/
   calculateSlope
/********************/

/********************/
    printResults
/********************/
</pre>
   </div>
   <h3>main Method</h3>
   <p>The code for all of the programs we done so far has been written entirely in the main method, 
      which is perfectly acceptable for small programs.  However, as the programs increase in size and
	  complexity, they become much more difficult to read, write, and maintain if all of the code
	  is contained within the main method.</p>
   <p>Let's look more closely at the stub program's main method.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
public static void main(String[] args)
{
   SlopeCalculator app = new SlopeCalculator();
   app.getPoints();
   app.calculateSlope();
   app.printResults();
}   
   </pre>
   </div>
   <p>Notice that the main method has a different look now because its job has changed to be more of a
      manager or facilitator. Its new purpose is to simply call the other methods of the class. This is accomplished
	  by creating an object of the class the main method belongs. In Steve's program the main
	  method is a member of the SlopeCalculator class, therefore Steve instantiates an object
	  of this class.</p>
     <div id="csCode">
    <pre>SlopeCalculator <div id="csHighlight"><pre>app</pre></div> = new SlopeCalculator();</pre>
   </div>
   <p>Once the object has been instantiated dot notation can be used to access the other methods
      of the class.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>app.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>getPoints</pre></div>();
app.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>calculateSlope</pre></div>();
app.<div id="csHighlight"><pre>printResults</pre></div>(); </pre>
   </div>
  <p>The methods will execute in the order they are called. When a method's code has been 
     completed, the program will return to the main method and execution will continue with the next method call.</p>
  <p>The illustration below demonstrates the flow of execution for stub program.</p> 
    <div class = "slider" id="slider2">
       <ul class="bjqs">
          <li><img src="images/Methods2/Slide1.PNG"></li>
          <li><img src="images/Methods2/Slide2.PNG"></li>
          <li><img src="images/Methods2/Slide3.PNG"></li>

		  <li><img src="images/Methods2/Slide15.PNG"></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
	<br><br>
  <h3>Step 2 - Create Variables</h3>
  <p>Steve creates six variables for his program. The first variable will store the Scanner object
     needed to get keyboard input. The second variable will store the result of the slope
	 calculation. The rest of the variables will store the values for the (x, y) coordinates of
	 the two points.</p>
	 <div id="csCode">
	   <pre>
private Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
private double slope = 0;
private int x1 = 0;
private int y1 = 0;	 
private int x2 = 0;	 
private int y2 = 0;</pre>
	 </div>
<p>Notice the use of the keyword <strong>private</strong> in front of each variable's data type. This is the variable's
   access modifier. The private modifier means that the variable cannot be used or seen outside the
   class it was defined in. Although the variables will still work without declaring them private,
   it is a good programming habit. The reason we declare variables private will become more apparent
   in another unit.</p>
   
   <p>Here is the stub program with the variable declarations included.</p>

	 <div id="csCode">
	   
    <pre>
import java.util.*;

public class SlopeCalculator
{
    // instance variables
    <div id="csHighlight"><pre>private Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
    private double slope = 0;
    private int x1 = 0;
    private int y1 = 0;
    private int x2 = 0;
    private int y2 = 0;</pre></div>
	
    // Precondition: none
    // Postcondition: values of two points have been
    //     retrieved from keyboard
    public void getPoints()
    {
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println("     getPoints");
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Precondition: none
    // Postcondition: slope has been calculated
    public void calculateSlope()
    {
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println("   calculateSlope");
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Precondition: none
    // Postcondition: displayed slope
    public void printResults()
    {
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println("    printResults");
        System.out.println("/********************/");
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        SlopeCalculator app = new SlopeCalculator();
        app.getPoints();
        app.calculateSlope();
        app.printResults();
    }
}</pre>
	 </div>
  <p>Notice that Steve declared his variables at the top of the class, not in the 
    main method. If you declare a variable in a method it can only be used in 
    that method. By declaring them at the top of the class they are made available 
    to any of the methods within the class. The places a variable can be used 
    is referred to as <strong>variable scope</strong>. We will look more closely 
    at variable scope in the next lesson.</p>
  <h3>Step 3 - Code Methods</h3>
  <p>Since Steve started coding by writing a stub program he can now write the code for each 
     method separately; testing them one at a time. He starts by coding the method getPoints.
	 He compiles and executes the program to verify that getPoints is correct before coding
	 the other two methods.</p>
	 <h3>Build 1</h3>
    <div id="csCode">
